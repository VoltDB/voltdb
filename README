What is VoltDB?

If you have installed VoltDB from the distribution kit, you now have 
a directory containing this README file and several subdirectories, 
including:

bin      - Scripts for starting VoltDB, the export client, catalog
           compiler, and SQL command tool

examples - sample programs demonstrating the use of VoltDB
lib      - Third party libraries

The easiest way to get started using VoltDB is to try building and 
running one or more of the sample programs. Read examples/README for 
instructions. There is also a more complete tutorial describing the 
Hello World program in _Getting Started with VoltDB_ which is 
available online:
