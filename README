What is VoltDB?
====================
VoltDB is a horizontally-scalable, in-memory SQL RDBMS designed for 
applications that have extremely high read and write throughput 
requirements.

Getting Started
===============
If you have installed VoltDB from the distribution kit, you now have 
a directory containing this README file and several subdirectories, 
including:

bin      - Scripts for compiling the application catalog, starting 
           VoltDB, bulk loading data, as well as interacting with
           and managing the running database
doc      - Documentation, tutorials, and java-doc
examples - sample programs demonstrating the use of VoltDB
lib      - Third party libraries
tools    - XML schemas, monitoring plugins, and other tools
voltdb   - the VoltDB software itself

The easiest way to get started using VoltDB is to try building and 
running one or more of the sample programs. Read examples/README for 
instructions. There is also a complete tutorial available online:
