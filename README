What is VoltDB?
====================
VoltDB is a horizontally-scalable, in-memory SQL RDBMS designed for 
applications that have extremely high read and write throughput 
requirements.


Getting Started
===============
If you have installed VoltDB from the distribution kit, you now have 
a directory containing this README file and several subdirectories, 
including:

bin      - Scripts for starting VoltDB, the export client, catalog
           compiler, and SQL command tool
doc      - Using VoltDB guide, Management guide, tutorials, java-doc
examples - sample programs demonstrating the use of VoltDB
lib      - Third party libraries
tools    - SQLCmd tool, Web dashboard, project generator, XML schemas
voltdb   - the VoltDB software itself

The easiest way to get started using VoltDB is to try building and 
running one or more of the sample programs. Read examples/README for 
instructions. There is also a more complete tutorial describing the 
Hello World program in _Getting Started with VoltDB_ which is 
available online:
