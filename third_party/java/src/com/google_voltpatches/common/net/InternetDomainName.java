/**
 * An immutable well-formed internet domain name, such as {@code com} or {@code
 * foo.co.uk}. Only syntactic analysis is performed; no DNS lookups or other
 * network interactions take place. Thus there is no guarantee that the domain
 * actually exists on the internet.
 *
 * <p>One common use of this class is to determine whether a given string is
 * likely to represent an addressable domain on the web -- that is, for a
 * candidate string {@code "xxx"}, might browsing to {@code "http://xxx/"}
 * result in a webpage being displayed? In the past, this test was frequently
 * done by determining whether the domain ended with a {@linkplain
 * #isPublicSuffix() public suffix} but was not itself a public suffix. However,
 * this test is no longer accurate. There are many domains which are both public
 * suffixes and addressable as hosts; {@code "uk.com"} is one example. As a
 * result, the only useful test to determine if a domain is a plausible web host
 * is {@link #hasPublicSuffix()}. This will return {@code true} for many domains
 * which (currently) are not hosts, such as {@code "com"}, but given that any
 * public suffix may become a host without warning, it is better to err on the
 * side of permissiveness and thus avoid spurious rejection of valid sites.
 *
 * <p>During construction, names are normalized in two ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li>ASCII uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.
 * <li>Unicode dot separators other than the ASCII period ({@code '.'}) are
 * converted to the ASCII period.
 * </ol>
 * <p>The normalized values will be returned from {@link #toString()} and
 * {@link #parts()}, and will be reflected in the result of
 * {@link #equals(Object)}.
 *
 * <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">
 * Internationalized domain names</a> such as {@code 网络.cn} are supported, as
 * are the equivalent <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">IDNA
 * Punycode-encoded</a> versions.
