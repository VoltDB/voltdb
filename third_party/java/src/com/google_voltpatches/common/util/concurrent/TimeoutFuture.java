   * Memory visibility of these fields. There are two cases to consider.
   *
   * 1. visibility of the writes to these fields to Fire.run:
   *
   * The initial write to delegateRef is made definitely visible via the semantics of
   * addListener/SES.schedule. The later racy write in cancel() is not guaranteed to be observed,
   * however that is fine since the correctness is based on the atomic state in our base class. The
   * initial write to timer is never definitely visible to Fire.run since it is assigned after
   * SES.schedule is called. Therefore Fire.run has to check for null. However, it should be visible
   * if Fire.run is called by delegate.addListener since addListener is called after the assignment
   * to timer, and importantly this is the main situation in which we need to be able to see the
   * write.
   *
   * 2. visibility of the writes to an afterDone() call triggered by cancel():
   *
   * Since these fields are non-final that means that TimeoutFuture is not being 'safely published',
   * thus a motivated caller may be able to expose the reference to another thread that would then
   * call cancel() and be unable to cancel the delegate.
   * There are a number of ways to solve this, none of which are very pretty, and it is currently
   * believed to be a purely theoretical problem (since the other actions should supply sufficient
   * write-barriers).
