/**
 * A {@link Future} that accepts completion listeners. Each listener has an associated executor, and
 * it is invoked using this executor once the future's computation is {@linkplain Future#isDone()
 * complete}. If the computation has already completed when the listener is added, the listener will
 * execute immediately.
 * 
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on
 * <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ListenableFutureExplained">
 * {@code ListenableFuture}</a>.
 *
 * <h3>Purpose</h3>
 *
 * <p>The main purpose of {@code ListenableFuture} is to help you chain together a graph of
 * asynchronous operations. You can chain them together manually with calls to methods like
 * {@link Futures#transform(ListenableFuture, Function, Executor) Futures.transform}, but you will
 * often find it easier to use a framework. Frameworks automate the process, often adding features
 * like monitoring, debugging, and cancellation. Examples of frameworks include:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href="http://google.github.io/dagger/producers.html">Dagger Producers</a>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The main purpose of {@link #addListener addListener} is to support this chaining. You will
 * rarely use it directly, in part because it does not provide direct access to the {@code Future}
 * result. (If you want such access, you may prefer {@link Futures#addCallback
 * Futures.addCallback}.) Still, direct {@code addListener} calls are occasionally useful:
 *
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   final String name = ...;
 *   inFlight.add(name);
 *   ListenableFuture<Result> future = service.query(name);
 *   future.addListener(new Runnable() {
 *     public void run() {
 *       processedCount.incrementAndGet();
 *       inFlight.remove(name);
 *       lastProcessed.set(name);
 *       logger.info("Done with {0}", name);
 *     }
 *   }, executor);}</pre>
 *
 * <h3>How to get an instance</h3>
 *
 * <p>We encourage you to return {@code ListenableFuture} from your methods so that your users can
 * take advantage of the {@linkplain Futures utilities built atop the class}. The way that you will
 * create {@code ListenableFuture} instances depends on how you currently create {@code Future}
 * instances:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If you receive them from an {@code java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}, convert that
 *     service to a {@link ListeningExecutorService}, usually by calling
 *     {@link MoreExecutors#listeningDecorator(java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService)
 *     MoreExecutors.listeningDecorator}.
 * <li>If you manually call {@link java.util.concurrent.FutureTask#set} or a similar method, create
 *     a {@link SettableFuture} instead. (If your needs are more complex, you may prefer
 *     {@link AbstractFuture}.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Test doubles</b>: If you need a {@code ListenableFuture} for your test, try a {@link
 * SettableFuture} or one of the methods in the {@link Futures#immediateFuture Futures.immediate*}
 * family. <b>Avoid</b> creating a mock or stub {@code Future}. Mock and stub implementations are
 * fragile because they assume that only certain methods will be called and because they often
 * implement subtleties of the API improperly.
 *
 * <p><b>Custom implementation</b>: Avoid implementing {@code ListenableFuture} from scratch. If you
 * can't get by with the standard implementations, prefer to derive a new {@code Future} instance
 * with the methods in {@link Futures} or, if necessary, to extend {@link AbstractFuture}.
 *
 * <p>Occasionally, an API will return a plain {@code Future} and it will be impossible to change
 * the return type. For this case, we provide a more expensive workaround in {@code
 * JdkFutureAdapters}. However, when possible, it is more efficient and reliable to create a {@code
 * ListenableFuture} directly.

   * Registers a listener to be {@linkplain Executor#execute(Runnable) run} on the given executor.
   * The listener will run when the {@code Future}'s computation is {@linkplain Future#isDone()
   * complete} or, if the computation is already complete, immediately.
   *
   * <p>There is no guaranteed ordering of execution of listeners, but any listener added through
   * this method is guaranteed to be called once the computation is complete.
   *
   * <p>Exceptions thrown by a listener will be propagated up to the executor. Any exception thrown
   * during {@code Executor.execute} (e.g., a {@code RejectedExecutionException} or an exception
   * thrown by {@linkplain MoreExecutors#directExecutor direct execution}) will be caught and
   * logged.
   *
   * <p>Note: For fast, lightweight listeners that would be safe to execute in any thread, consider
   * {@link MoreExecutors#directExecutor}. Otherwise, avoid it. Heavyweight {@code directExecutor}
   * listeners can cause problems, and these problems can be difficult to reproduce because they
   * depend on timing. For example:
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>The listener may be executed by the caller of {@code addListener}. That caller may be a UI
   * thread or other latency-sensitive thread. This can harm UI responsiveness.
   * <li>The listener may be executed by the thread that completes this {@code Future}. That thread
   * may be an internal system thread such as an RPC network thread. Blocking that thread may stall
   * progress of the whole system. It may even cause a deadlock.
   * <li>The listener may delay other listeners, even listeners that are not themselves {@code
   * directExecutor} listeners.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This is the most general listener interface. For common operations performed using
   * listeners, see {@link Futures}. For a simplified but general listener interface, see {@link
   * Futures#addCallback addCallback()}.
   *
   * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to adding a listener <a
   * href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5">
   * <i>happen-before</i></a> its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.
   *
   * @param listener the listener to run when the computation is complete
   * @param executor the executor to run the listener in
   * @throws RejectedExecutionException if we tried to execute the listener immediately but the
   *     executor rejected it.
