/**
 * A settable future that can be set asynchronously via {@link #setFuture}.
 * A similar effect could be accomplished by adding a listener to the delegate
 * future that sets a normal settable future after the delegate is complete.
 * This approach gains us the ability to keep track of whether a delegate has
 * been set (i.e. so that we can prevent collisions from setting it twice and
 * can know before the computation is done whether it has been set), as well
 * as improved cancellation semantics (i.e. if either future is cancelled,
 * then the other one is too).  This class is thread-safe.
 *
 * @param <V> The result type returned by the Future's {@code get} method.
