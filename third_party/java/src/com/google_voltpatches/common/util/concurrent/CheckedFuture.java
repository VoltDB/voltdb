/**
 * A {@code CheckedFuture} is a {@link ListenableFuture} that includes versions
 * of the {@code get} methods that can throw a checked exception.  This makes it
 * easier to create a future that executes logic which can throw an exception.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> We recommend against using {@code CheckedFuture} in new
 * projects. {@code CheckedFuture} is difficult to build libraries atop. {@code
 * CheckedFuture} ports of methods like {@link Futures#transformAsync} have
 * historically had bugs, and some of these bugs are necessary, unavoidable
 * consequences of the {@code CheckedFuture} API. Additionally, {@code
 * CheckedFuture} encourages users to take exceptions from one thread and
 * rethrow them in another, producing confusing stack traces.
 *
 * <p>A common implementation is {@link Futures#immediateCheckedFuture}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface must adapt the exceptions thrown by
 * {@code Future#get()}: {@link CancellationException},
 * {@link ExecutionException} and {@link InterruptedException} into the type
 * specified by the {@code X} type parameter.
 *
 * <p>This interface also extends the ListenableFuture interface to allow
 * listeners to be added. This allows the future to be used as a normal
 * {@link Future} or as an asynchronous callback mechanism as needed. This
 * allows multiple callbacks to be registered for a particular task, and the
 * future will guarantee execution of all listeners when the task completes.
 * 
 * <p>For a simpler alternative to CheckedFuture, consider accessing Future 
 * values with {@link Futures#getChecked(Future, Class) Futures.getChecked()}.
