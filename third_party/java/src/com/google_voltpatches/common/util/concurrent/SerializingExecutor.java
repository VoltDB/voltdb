/**
 * Executor ensuring that all Runnables submitted are executed in order, using the provided
 * Executor, and serially such that no two will ever be running at the same time.
 *
 * <p>Tasks submitted to {@link #execute(Runnable)} are executed in FIFO order.
 *
 * <p>Tasks can also be prepended to the queue to be executed in LIFO order before any other
 * submitted tasks. Primarily intended for the currently executing task to be able to schedule a
 * continuation task.
 *
 * <p>Execution on the queue can be {@linkplain #suspend suspended}, e.g. while waiting for an RPC,
 * and execution can be {@linkplain #resume resumed} later.
 *
 * <p>The execution of tasks is done by one thread as long as there are tasks left in the queue and
 * execution has not been suspended. (Even if one task is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted},
 * execution of subsequent tasks continues.) {@code RuntimeException}s thrown by tasks are simply
 * logged and the executor keeps trucking. If an {@code Error} is thrown, the error will propagate
 * and execution will stop until it is restarted by external calls.
