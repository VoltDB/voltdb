/**
 * Produces proxies that impose a time limit on method calls to the proxied object. For example, to
 * return the value of {@code target.someMethod()}, but substitute {@code DEFAULT_VALUE} if this
 * method call takes over 50 ms, you can use this code:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   TimeLimiter limiter = . . .;
 *   TargetType proxy = limiter.newProxy(
 *       target, TargetType.class, 50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
 *   try {
 *     return proxy.someMethod();
 *   } catch (UncheckedTimeoutException e) {
 *     return DEFAULT_VALUE;
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Please see {@code SimpleTimeLimiterTest} for more usage examples.

  /**
   * Returns an instance of {@code interfaceType} that delegates all method calls to the
   * {@code target} object, enforcing the specified time limit on each call. This time-limited
   * delegation is also performed for calls to {@link Object#equals}, {@link Object#hashCode}, and
   * {@link Object#toString}.
   *
   * <p>If the target method call finishes before the limit is reached, the return value or
   * exception is propagated to the caller exactly as-is. If, on the other hand, the time limit is
   * reached, the proxy will attempt to abort the call to the target, and will throw an
   * {@link UncheckedTimeoutException} to the caller.
   *
   * <p>It is important to note that the primary purpose of the proxy object is to return control to
   * the caller when the timeout elapses; aborting the target method call is of secondary concern.
   * The particular nature and strength of the guarantees made by the proxy is
   * implementation-dependent. However, it is important that each of the methods on the target
   * object behaves appropriately when its thread is interrupted.
