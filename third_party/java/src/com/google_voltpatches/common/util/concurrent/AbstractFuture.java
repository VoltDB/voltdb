/**
 * An abstract implementation of {@link ListenableFuture}, intended for advanced users only. More
 * common ways to create a {@code ListenableFuture} include instantiating a {@link SettableFuture},
 * submitting a task to a {@link ListeningExecutorService}, and deriving a {@code Future} from an
 * existing one, typically using methods like {@link Futures#transform(ListenableFuture, Function)
 * Futures.transform} and {@link Futures#catching(ListenableFuture, Class, Function)
 * Futures.catching}.
 *
 * <p>This class implements all methods in {@code ListenableFuture}. Subclasses should provide a way
 * to set the result of the computation through the protected methods {@link #set(Object)}, {@link
 * #setFuture(ListenableFuture)} and {@link #setException(Throwable)}. Subclasses may also override
 * {@link #interruptTask()}, which will be invoked automatically if a call to {@link
 * #cancel(boolean) cancel(true)} succeeds in canceling the future. Subclasses should rarely
 * override other methods.

  // There are a few design constraints to consider
  // * We want to be responsive to small timeouts, unpark() has non trivial latency overheads (I
  //   have observed 12 micros on 64 bit linux systems to wake up a parked thread). So if the
  //   timeout is small we shouldn't park(). This needs to be traded off with the cpu overhead of
  //   spinning, so we use SPIN_THRESHOLD_NANOS which is what AbstractQueuedSynchronizer uses for
  //   similar purposes.
  // * We want to behave reasonably for timeouts of 0
  // * We are more responsive to completion than timeouts. This is because parkNanos depends on
  //   system scheduling and as such we could either miss our deadline, or unpark() could be delayed
  //   so that it looks like we timed out even though we didn't. For comparison FutureTask respects
  //   completion preferably and AQS is non-deterministic (depends on where in the queue the waiter
  //   is). If we wanted to be strict about it, we could store the unpark() time in the Waiter node
  //   and we could use that to make a decision about whether or not we timed out prior to being
  //   unparked.
