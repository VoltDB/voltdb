/**
 * An interface for <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>-structured data,
 * whose edges are unique objects.
 *
 * <p>A graph is composed of a set of nodes and a set of edges connecting pairs of nodes.
 *
 * <p>There are three main interfaces provided to represent graphs. In order of increasing
 * complexity they are: {@link Graph}, {@link ValueGraph}, and {@link Network}. You should generally
 * prefer the simplest interface that satisfies your use case. See the <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#choosing-the-right-graph-type">
 * "Choosing the right graph type"</a> section of the Guava User Guide for more details.
 *
 * <h3>Capabilities</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@code Network} supports the following use cases (<a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#definitions">definitions of
 * terms</a>):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>directed graphs
 *   <li>undirected graphs
 *   <li>graphs that do/don't allow parallel edges
 *   <li>graphs that do/don't allow self-loops
 *   <li>graphs whose nodes/edges are insertion-ordered, sorted, or unordered
 *   <li>graphs whose edges are unique objects
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Building a {@code Network}</h3>
 *
 * <p>The implementation classes that `common.graph` provides are not public, by design. To create
 * an instance of one of the built-in implementations of {@code Network}, use the {@link
 * NetworkBuilder} class:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   MutableNetwork<Integer, MyEdge> graph = NetworkBuilder.directed().build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>{@link NetworkBuilder#build()} returns an instance of {@link MutableNetwork}, which is a
 * subtype of {@code Network} that provides methods for adding and removing nodes and edges. If you
 * do not need to mutate a graph (e.g. if you write a method than runs a read-only algorithm on the
 * graph), you should use the non-mutating {@link Network} interface, or an {@link
 * ImmutableNetwork}.
 *
 * <p>You can create an immutable copy of an existing {@code Network} using {@link
 * ImmutableNetwork#copyOf(Network)}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   ImmutableNetwork<Integer, MyEdge> immutableGraph = ImmutableNetwork.copyOf(graph);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@link ImmutableNetwork} do not implement {@link MutableNetwork} (obviously!) and
 * are contractually guaranteed to be unmodifiable and thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>The Guava User Guide has <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#building-graph-instances">more
 * information on (and examples of) building graphs</a>.
 *
 * <h3>Additional documentation</h3>
 *

 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained">"Graphs Explained"</a>) for
