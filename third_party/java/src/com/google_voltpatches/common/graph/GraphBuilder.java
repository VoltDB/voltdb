/**
 * A builder for constructing instances of {@link MutableGraph} with user-defined properties.

 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>does not allow self-loops

 *
 * <p>Example of use:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * MutableGraph<String> graph = GraphBuilder.undirected().allowsSelfLoops(true).build();
 * graph.putEdge("bread", "bread");
 * graph.putEdge("chocolate", "peanut butter");
 * graph.putEdge("peanut butter", "jelly");
