/**
 * An interface for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>-
 * structured data, whose edges have associated non-unique values.
 *
 * <p>A graph is composed of a set of nodes and a set of edges connecting pairs of nodes.
 *
 * <p>There are three main interfaces provided to represent graphs. In order of increasing
 * complexity they are: {@link Graph}, {@link ValueGraph}, and {@link Network}. You should generally
 * prefer the simplest interface that satisfies your use case. See the <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#choosing-the-right-graph-type">
 * "Choosing the right graph type"</a> section of the Guava User Guide for more details.
 *
 * <h3>Capabilities</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@code ValueGraph} supports the following use cases (<a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#definitions">definitions of
 * terms</a>):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>directed graphs
 *   <li>undirected graphs
 *   <li>graphs that do/don't allow self-loops
 *   <li>graphs whose nodes/edges are insertion-ordered, sorted, or unordered
 *   <li>graphs whose edges have associated values
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code ValueGraph}, as a subtype of {@code Graph}, explicitly does not support parallel edges,
 * and forbids implementations or extensions with parallel edges. If you need parallel edges, use
 * {@link Network}. (You can use a positive {@code Integer} edge value as a loose representation of
 * edge multiplicity, but the {@code *degree()} and mutation methods will not reflect your
 * interpretation of the edge value as its multiplicity.)
 *
 * <h3>Building a {@code ValueGraph}</h3>
 *
 * <p>The implementation classes that `common.graph` provides are not public, by design. To create
 * an instance of one of the built-in implementations of {@code ValueGraph}, use the {@link
 * ValueGraphBuilder} class:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   MutableValueGraph<Integer, Double> graph = ValueGraphBuilder.directed().build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>{@link ValueGraphBuilder#build()} returns an instance of {@link MutableValueGraph}, which is a
 * subtype of {@code ValueGraph} that provides methods for adding and removing nodes and edges. If
 * you do not need to mutate a graph (e.g. if you write a method than runs a read-only algorithm on
 * the graph), you should use the non-mutating {@link ValueGraph} interface, or an {@link
 * ImmutableValueGraph}.
 *
 * <p>You can create an immutable copy of an existing {@code ValueGraph} using {@link
 * ImmutableValueGraph#copyOf(ValueGraph)}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   ImmutableValueGraph<Integer, Double> immutableGraph = ImmutableValueGraph.copyOf(graph);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@link ImmutableValueGraph} do not implement {@link MutableValueGraph}
 * (obviously!) and are contractually guaranteed to be unmodifiable and thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>The Guava User Guide has <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#building-graph-instances">more
 * information on (and examples of) building graphs</a>.
