/**
 * A constraint that an element must satisfy in order to be added to a
 * collection. For example, {@link Constraints#notNull()}, which prevents a
 * collection from including any null elements, could be implemented like this:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   public Object checkElement(Object element) {
 *     if (element == null) {
 *       throw new NullPointerException();
 *     }
 *     return element;
 *   }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In order to be effective, constraints should be deterministic; that is,
 * they should not depend on state that can change (such as external state,
 * random variables, and time) and should only depend on the value of the
 * passed-in element. A non-deterministic constraint cannot reliably enforce
 * that all the collection's elements meet the constraint, since the constraint
 * is only enforced when elements are added.
