/**
 * <p>A builder of {@link ConcurrentMap} instances having any combination of the following features:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>keys or values automatically wrapped in {@linkplain WeakReference weak} or {@linkplain
 *     SoftReference soft} references
 * <li>notification of evicted (or otherwise removed) entries
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usage example: <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   ConcurrentMap<Request, Stopwatch> timers = new MapMaker()
 *       .concurrencyLevel(4)
 *       .weakKeys()
 *       .makeMap();}</pre>
 *
 * <p>These features are all optional; {@code new MapMaker().makeMap()} returns a valid concurrent
 * map that behaves similarly to a {@link ConcurrentHashMap}.
 *
 * <p>The returned map is implemented as a hash table with similar performance characteristics to
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap}. It supports all optional operations of the {@code ConcurrentMap}
 * interface. It does not permit null keys or values.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> by default, the returned map uses equality comparisons (the {@link Object#equals
 * equals} method) to determine equality for keys or values. However, if {@link #weakKeys} was
 * specified, the map uses identity ({@code ==}) comparisons instead for keys. Likewise, if {@link
 * #weakValues} or {@link #softValues} was specified, the map uses identity comparisons for values.
 *
 * <p>The view collections of the returned map have <i>weakly consistent iterators</i>. This means
 * that they are safe for concurrent use, but if other threads modify the map after the iterator is
 * created, it is undefined which of these changes, if any, are reflected in that iterator. These
 * iterators never throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 *
 * <p>If {@link #weakKeys}, {@link #weakValues}, or {@link #softValues} are requested, it is
 * possible for a key or value present in the map to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. Entries
 * with reclaimed keys or values may be removed from the map on each map modification or on
 * occasional map accesses; such entries may be counted by {@link Map#size}, but will never be
 * visible to read or write operations. A partially-reclaimed entry is never exposed to the user.
 * Any {@link java.util.Map.Entry} instance retrieved from the map's
 * {@linkplain Map#entrySet entry set} is a snapshot of that entry's state at the time of
 * retrieval; such entries do, however, support {@link java.util.Map.Entry#setValue}, which simply
 * calls {@link Map#put} on the entry's key.
 *
 * <p>The maps produced by {@code MapMaker} are serializable, and the deserialized maps retain all
 * the configuration properties of the original map. During deserialization, if the original map had
 * used soft or weak references, the entries are reconstructed as they were, but it's not unlikely
 * they'll be quickly garbage-collected before they are ever accessed.
 *
 * <p>{@code new MapMaker().weakKeys().makeMap()} is a recommended replacement for {@link
 * java.util.WeakHashMap}, but note that it compares keys using object identity whereas {@code
 * WeakHashMap} uses {@link Object#equals}.
