/**
 * A constraint on the keys and values that may be added to a {@code Map} or {@code Multimap}. For
 * example, to prevent a map from including any null keys or values, you could implement a {@link
 * MapConstraint} like this:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public void checkKeyValue(Object key, Object value) {
 *   if (key == null || value == null) {
 *     throw new NullPointerException();
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In order to be effective, constraints should be deterministic; that is, they should not depend
 * on state that can change (such as external state, random variables, and time) and should only
 * depend on the value of the passed-in key and value. A non-deterministic constraint cannot
 * reliably enforce that all the collection's elements meet the constraint, since the constraint is
 * only enforced when elements are added.

 *     encourage you to check your preconditions explicitly instead of leaving that work to the map
 *     implementation. For the specific case of rejecting null, consider {@link ImmutableMap}. This
 *     class is scheduled for removal in Guava 21.0.
