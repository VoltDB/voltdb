/**
 * A destination to which characters can be written, such as a text file. Unlike a {@link Writer}, a
 * {@code CharSink} is not an open, stateful stream that can be written to and closed. Instead, it
 * is an immutable <i>supplier</i> of {@code Writer} instances.
 *
 * <p>{@code CharSink} provides two kinds of methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Methods that return a writer:</b> These methods should return a <i>new</i>, independent
 *     instance each time they are called. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the returned
 *     writer is closed.
 * <li><b>Convenience methods:</b> These are implementations of common operations that are typically
 *     implemented by opening a writer using one of the methods in the first category, doing
 *     something and finally closing the writer that was opened.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Any {@link ByteSink} may be viewed as a {@code CharSink} with a specific {@linkplain Charset
 * character encoding} using {@link ByteSink#asCharSink(Charset)}. Characters written to the
 * resulting {@code CharSink} will written to the {@code ByteSink} as encoded bytes.
