/**
 * A readable source of characters, such as a text file. Unlike a {@link Reader}, a
 * {@code CharSource} is not an open, stateful stream of characters that can be read and closed.
 * Instead, it is an immutable <i>supplier</i> of {@code Reader} instances.
 *
 * <p>{@code CharSource} provides two kinds of methods:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Methods that return a reader:</b> These methods should return a <i>new</i>, independent
 *   instance each time they are called. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the returned
 *   reader is closed.
 *   <li><b>Convenience methods:</b> These are implementations of common operations that are
 *   typically implemented by opening a reader using one of the methods in the first category,
 *   doing something and finally closing the reader that was opened.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Several methods in this class, such as {@link #readLines()}, break the contents of the
 * source into lines. Like {@link BufferedReader}, these methods break lines on any of {@code \n},
 * {@code \r} or {@code \r\n}, do not include the line separator in each line and do not consider
 * there to be an empty line at the end if the contents are terminated with a line separator.
 *
 * <p>Any {@link ByteSource} containing text encoded with a specific {@linkplain Charset character
 * encoding} may be viewed as a {@code CharSource} using {@link ByteSource#asCharSource(Charset)}.
