/**
 * PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENTATION BEFORE USING THIS ANNOTATION!
 * Note the criteria listed below which cannot be enforced by static analysis in
 * j2objc. Prefer using {@link Weak} over @RetainedWith if possible.
 *
 * Indicates that the annotated field (child) forms a direct reference cycle
 * with the referring object (parent). Adding this annotation informs J2ObjC of
 * the reference cycle between the pair of objects allowing both objects to be
 * deallocated once there are no external references to either object.
 *
 * {@literal @}RetainedWith can be applied when a parent object pairs itself
 * with a child object and cannot fully manage the child's lifecycle, usually
 * because the child is returned to the caller. It can also be applied when the
 * child has the same class as the parent, for example on an inverse field of an
 * invertible collection type.
 *
 * {@literal @}RetainedWith can only be applied where there is a two-object pair
 * with a cycle created by one reference from each object. Note: the two
 * references can be from the same declared field. When the references are from
 * different fields only one field should be given a @RetainedWith annotation,
 * and the {@literal @}RetainedWith field should point from parent to child.
 *
 * When applied carefully in the right circumstance this annotation is very
 * useful in preventing leaks from certain Java collection types without needing
 * to alter their behavior.
 *
 * The following criteria must be adhered to otherwise behavior will be
 * undefined:
 * - The @RetainedWithfield, once assigned, must not be reassigned.
 * - The child object must not reassign any references back to the parent
 *   object. Preferably references from child to parent are declared final.
 * - The child object must not contain any {@link Weak} references back to the
 *   parent object.
 * - The child object must not be available to other threads at the time of
 *   assignment. (Normally, the cycle is created upon construction of the child)
