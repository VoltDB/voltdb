/**
 * The class to which this annotation is applied is immutable.
 *
 * <p>An object is immutable if its state cannot be observed to change after construction. Immutable
 * objects are inherently thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>A class is immutable if all instances of that class are immutable. The immutability of a class
 * can only be fully guaranteed if the class is final, otherwise one must ensure all subclasses are
 * also immutable.
 *
 * <p>A conservative definition of object immutability is:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>All fields are final;
 * <li>All reference fields are of immutable type, or null;
 * <li>It is <em>properly constructed</em> (the {@code this} reference does not escape the
 * constructor).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The requirement that all reference fields be immutable ensures <em>deep</em>
 * immutability, meaning all contained state is also immutable. A weaker property, common with
 * container classes, is <em>shallow</em> immutability, which allows some of the object's fields to
 * point to mutable objects. One example of shallow immutability is guava's ImmutableList, which
 * may contain mutable elements.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to implement immutable classes with some internal mutable state, as long as
 * callers can never observe changes to that state. For example, some state may be lazily
 * initialized to improve performance.
 *
 * <p>It is also technically possible to have an immutable object with non-final fields (see the
 * implementation of {@link String#hashCode()} for an example), but doing this correctly requires
 * subtle reasoning about safe data races and deep knowledge of the Java Memory Model.
 *
 * Use of this annotation is validated by
 * <a href="http://errorprone.info/bugpatterns/ImmutableChecker">Error Prone's immutability analysis</a>,
 * which ensures that all {@code @Immutable}-annotated classes are deeply immutable according to the
 * conservative definition above. Non-final classes may be annotated with {@code @Immutable}, and
 * any code compiled by Error Prone will be checked to ensure that no mutable subtypes of
 * {@code @Immutable}-annotated classes exist.
 *
 * <p>For more information about immutability, see:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Java Concurrency in Practice ยง3.4
 * <li>Effective Java ยง15
 * </ul>
