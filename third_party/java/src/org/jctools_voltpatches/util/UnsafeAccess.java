/**
 * Why should we resort to using Unsafe?<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>To construct class fields which allow volatile/ordered/plain access: This requirement is covered by
 * {@link AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater} and similar but their performance is arguably worse than the DIY approach
 * (depending on JVM version) while Unsafe intrinsification is a far lesser challenge for JIT compilers.
 * <li>To construct flavors of {@link AtomicReferenceArray}.
 * <li>Other use cases exist but are not present in this library yet.
