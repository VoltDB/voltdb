/**
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser} instances provide an asymmetric means for synchronizing the execution of
 * wait-free "writer" critical sections against a "reader phase flip" that needs to make sure no writer critical
 * sections that were active at the beginning of the flip are still active after the flip is done. Multiple writers
 * and multiple readers are supported.
 * <p>
 * While a {@link WriterReaderPhaser} can be useful in multiple scenarios, a specific and common use case is
 * that of safely managing "double buffered" data stream access in which writers can proceed without being
 * blocked, while readers gain access to stable and unchanging buffer samples
 * <blockquote>
 * NOTE: {@link WriterReaderPhaser} writers are wait-free on architectures that support wait-free atomic
 * increment operations. They remain lock-free (but not wait-free) on architectures that do not support
 * wait-free atomic increment operations.
 * </blockquote>
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser} "writers" are wait free, "readers" block for other "readers", and
 * "readers" are only blocked by "writers" whose critical was entered before the reader's
 * {@link WriterReaderPhaser#flipPhase()} attempt.
 * <p>
 * When used to protect an actively recording data structure, the assumptions on how readers and writers act are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>There are two sets of data structures ("active" and "inactive")</li>
 * <li>Writing is done to the perceived active version (as perceived by the writer), and only
 *     within critical sections delineated by {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionEnter}
 *     and {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionExit}).</li>
 * <li>Only readers switch the perceived roles of the active and inactive data structures.
 *     They do so only while under readerLock(), and only before calling flipPhase().</li>
 * </ol>
 * When the above assumptions are met, {@link WriterReaderPhaser} guarantees that the inactive data structures are not
 * being modified by any writers while being read while under readerLock() protection after a flipPhase()
 * operation.
