 \brief constants used in the library

 As our library is written in header files (templates) we cannot use
 constants like 'const int' etc. because we should have some source files
 *.cpp to define this variables. Only what we can have are constants
 defined by #define preprocessor macros.

 All macros are preceded by TTMATH_ prefix

 TTMATH_DEBUG
 this macro enables further testing during writing your code

 if this macro is set then macros TTMATH_ASSERT and TTMATH_REFERENCE_ASSERT
 are set as well and these macros can throw an exception if a condition in it
 is not fulfilled (look at the definition of TTMATH_ASSERT and TTMATH_REFERENCE_ASSERT)

 TTMATH_RELEASE
 if you are confident that your code is perfect you can define TTMATH_RELEASE
 macro for example by using -D option in gcc
 gcc -DTTMATH_RELEASE -o myprogram myprogram.cpp
 or by defining this macro in your code before using any header files of this library

 if TTMATH_RELEASE is not set then TTMATH_DEBUG is set automatically

 What is the 'reference' error?
 Some kind of methods use a reference as their argument to another object,
 and the another object not always can be the same which is calling, e.g.
 Big<1,2> foo(10);
 foo.Mul(foo); // this is incorrect
 above method Mul is making something more with 'this' object and
 'this' cannot be passed as the argument because the result will be undefined

 macro TTMATH_REFERENCE_ASSERT helps us to solve the above problem

 note! some methods can use 'this' object as the argument
 for example this code is correct:
 UInt<2> foo(10);
 foo.Add(foo);
