///
/// How to use:
/// You can pass the same type of proto buffer to EXPECT_PROTO_P?EQ, in
/// "expect, actual" order. For convenience, the first argument of the macros,
/// (i.e. expect), can take string literal. It'll be parsed appropriately.
/// Assuming the proto P has members a and b;
///
/// 1)
/// P actual;
/// ... (testing code) ...
/// P expected;
/// expected.set_a(expected_a);
/// expected.set_b(expected_b);
/// EXPECT_PROTO_EQ(expected, actual);
///
/// 2)
/// P actual;
/// ... (testing code) ...
/// EXPECT_PROTO_EQ("a: expected_a b: expected_b", actual);
///
/// and so on. We can use EXPECT_PROTO_PEQ instead of EXPECT_PROTO_EQ.
/// The difference between them is that EXPECT_PROTO_EQ compares all fields,
/// but EXPECT_PROTO_PEQ checks only fields which is set in "expected".
