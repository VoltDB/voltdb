We're currently using Boost 1.53.

It's mostly header-only and we specifically disable any references to boost::thread.

1.) Header only libraries.
    No included Boost files have been modified.

    Many files have been removed. If you use some new part of boost and it fails because a
    header is missing, you can get the full Boost tarball of the appropriate version and
    restore missing headers as needed.

    Feel free to remove headers that aren't used.
2.) Built libraries.
    We build the boost static libraries and check them in to git.  We build on a
    platform which is old enough that all other platforms are compatible with it.

    The build procedure is pretty simple, but it's appallingly manual.
    a.) Download the boost tarball.
    b.) Copy the needed header-only include files to the repository.
    c.) Configure, build and install the wanted built libraries statically using
        --fpic (for eg: ./b2 link=static --with-regex cxxflags=-fPIC). These
        are installed in some temporary location.  We only use the static
        libraries, to simplify packaging.
    d.) Copy the static libraries into the repository.  The static libraries
        are stored in voltdb/third_party/cpp/boost/lib/$ARCH/libxxx.a.
        where $ARCH is the name of the architecture, and xxx is the name
        of the library.  For now, the architecture on the mac is "Darwin",
        and the architecture for linux is "Linux".
    All of these steps are manual, and must be done each time the boost library
    is updated.  If we made a change to any of the boost sources these changes
    would have to be made as well.
