We're currently using Boost 1.53.

It's header-only and we specifically disable any references to boost::thread.

No included Boost files have been modified.

Many files have been removed. If you use some new part of boost and it fails because a
header is missing, you can get the full Boost tarball of the appropriate version and
restore missing headers as needed.

Feel free to remove headers that aren't used.
