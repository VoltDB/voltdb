# This script assumes a relative location in a root subdirectory of a voltdb
# distribution. The logic is intentionally minimal since almost all of the
# heavy lifting happens in runner.main(). The script name determines the verbs
# that are loaded from <name>.d subdirectories. It loads the version number
# from version.txt in the script's parent directory. It can be copied to other
# names, and also to other locations if the path-building is adjusted. The
# description should also be changed if re-used for another base command.
