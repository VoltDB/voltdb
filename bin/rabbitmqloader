# The VoltDB RabbitMQ Loader script (experimental)
#
# Requires prior installation of a rabbitmqloader distribution, either
# produced by building the GitHub repository,
# https://github.com/VoltDB/rabbitmq-bulkloader, or by downloading a
# pre-built .zip or .tgz archive file. As mentioned below, the
# RABBITMQLOADER_HOME environment variable must point to the base
# directory where the rabbitmq-bulkloader distribution was extracted.

The RABBITMQLOADER_HOME environment variable must be set.

If you have not already done so, please build or download a
rabbitmqloader distribution. See the Git repository README.

https://github.com/VoltDB/rabbitmq-bulkloader

Extract the distribution to a directory of your choice and set
RABBITMQLOADER_HOME to the absolute path of the extracted base
subdirectory. To set it permanently, add the environment variable to
your ~/.bashrc or equivalent shell startup configuration file.
