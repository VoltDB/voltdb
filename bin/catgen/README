This is the system catalog code and code generation.

Some notes on how to build/run this:

- Make sure you have python 2.4 or later.

- "./catalog.py" will produce the Java and C++ files into out/

- the static Java and C++ is in in/

Catalog usage notes:

- names cannot have spaces in them

- C++ protection is incorrect; stick to the orig design doc


Spec.txt syntax:

"*" indicates a child collection.
"?" reference (to another node's child elsewhere in the catalog).
