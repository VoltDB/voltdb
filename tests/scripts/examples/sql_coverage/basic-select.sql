-- This is a set of SELECT statements that tests the bare minimum
-- necessary to start to think that maybe we actually support the
-- subset of SQL that we claim to support.
--
-- In the brave new meta-template world (yeah, okay, kill me), these
-- statements expect that the includer will have set the template
-- @cmp_type to be the _value[???] type that makes sense for the
-- config under test.  So, if the configuration is pushing on string
-- operations, you'll want a line: {@cmp_type = "_value[string]"} in
-- the template file that includes this one.
