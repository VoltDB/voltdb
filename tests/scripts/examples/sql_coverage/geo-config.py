# This SQL coverage configuration set represents tests of the Geospatial
# features (added to version 6.0); as such, it must be run against PostgreSQL
# with the PostGIS extension, and not against HSQL. Hence, to run it, use
# something like the following:
#     ant -Dpostgis=1 -Dsql_coverage_suite=geo-config.py sqlcoverage
