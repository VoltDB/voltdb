This application is used to generate data for testing the C++ client.
It started out as the hello world application, but was changed in subtle
ways, wonderful to behold.

To generate the test data in a folder named "$D", first make a debug
build of VoltDB, either community or pro edition.  The bin directory
for the source distribution must be on your path.  Then run the
"run.sh" command found in this directory with the command line argument:
  ./run.sh --client-dir "$D"

The files will show up in "$D".

If you built a release build you will need to run
  ./run.sh --client-dir "$D" --build release

There are some other options, but they are mostly for debugging this tool.

  --working-dir "$OBJ"     Use "$OBJ" as the server's working directory.
                           This is useful if one must debug the server
                           while generating the test data.  By default
                           this is "./obj".
  --no-cleanup             Usually this script removes the server's
                           voltdbroot and log folders.  This keeps them.
                           Again, this is useful for debugging.
  --help                   Print a terse debugging message.
