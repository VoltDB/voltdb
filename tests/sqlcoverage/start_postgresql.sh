# on one of the Jenkins machines (e.g., by setting the CLASSPATH to a jar file
# in a specific directory that exists on those machines), as USER 'test'; failing
# that, it may not work, so user beware. Typical use would be to run this script
# first (using 'source' or '.', so that variable names are exported to the shell),
# then a set of SqlCoverage tests, and then the stop_postgresql.sh script.

# Code so that this also works on a Mac (OSTYPE darwin*), assuming that PostgreSQL
# is installed, the CLASSPATH has been set to include an appropriate PostgreSQL
# JDBC jar file, and the 'locate' command has been initialized
