# This file contains the "geo" tests, which are a subset of those run
# by the "postgis" sqlcoverage Jenkins job.

# These tests only work when run against PostgreSQL/PostGIS, not HSQL. Hence,
# to run them on the command line, use something like the following:
#     ant -Dpostgis=1 -Dsql_coverage_suite=postgis-geo-config.py sqlcoverage
