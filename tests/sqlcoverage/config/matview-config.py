# This file contains all but one of the (joined) "matview" tests run
# by the "matview" sqlcoverage Jenkins job. The one exception is the
# "joined-matview-int" test suite, which is in a separate file because
# it takes longer than all the other "matview" test suites combined.

# These tests only work when run against PostgreSQL (with or without
# PostGIS), not HSQL. Hence, to run them on the command line, use something
# like the following:
#     ant -Dpostgresql=1 -Dsql_coverage_suite=matview-config.py sqlcoverage

    # Tests of Materialized Views defined using Joins
