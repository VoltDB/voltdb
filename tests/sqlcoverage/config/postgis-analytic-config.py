# This file contains the "analytic" (default) and "analytic-strings" test
# suites, which are a subset of the "analytic" tests, which in turn are a
# subset of those run by the "postgis" sqlcoverage Jenkins job.

# These tests only work when run against PostgreSQL, not HSQL. Hence, to run
# them on the command line, use something like the following:
#     ant -Dpostgresql=1 -Dsql_coverage_suite=postgis-analytic-config.py sqlcoverage
{
    # Tests of SQL Analytic Windowed Functions (e.g. RANK, DENSE_RANK)
