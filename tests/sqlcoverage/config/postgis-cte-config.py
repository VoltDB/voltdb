# This file contains various CTE (Common Table Expression) test suites, i.e.,
# tests of WITH statements, including Recursive CTE (WITH RECURSIVE) tests,
# which are a subset of those run by the "postgis" sqlcoverage Jenkins job.

# These tests only work when run against PostgreSQL, not HSQL. Hence, to run
# them on the command line, use something like the following:
#     ant -Dpostgresql=1 -Dsql_coverage_suite=postgis-cte-config.py sqlcoverage
