# This file contains the miscellaneous tests (neither "basic" nor "advanced"),
# including those labeled "regression", which are a subset of those run by the
# main, or "default", sqlcoverage Jenkins job.


# TODO: the old note below (some of which may no longer be accurate) explains
# how the "regression" test suites were generated, and how they could be
# regenerated. We may wish to improve this process, at some point.

# HACK:
# Some of the template files
# generate statements that result in repeated failures due to functional
# differences between HSQL and VoltDB backends. In such cases, we work around
# these errors by generating a fixed sample query file and, after culling out
# any statements that cause mismatches, using it to replace the original
# template file name in the configuration list below.
# In this way, the sample file gets used as a trivial template file that passes
# through the generator untouched. It also has an unfortunate side-effect of
# causing any future improvements to the template to be ignored unless/until
# the sample file is manually re-generated from it and re-edited to eliminate
# mismatches.
#
# Actually, in the specific case of templates that generate random integer
# constant timestamp values, the template must be replaced by TWO separate
# generated sample files -- one generated for hsql with millisecond constants
# and one for VoltDB with microsecond constants (always 1000 X the hsql values).
# The hsql version of the sample file gets associated with the optional
# "template-hsqldb" key in the configuration. Otherwise, both hsql and VoltDB
# use the same input file associated with the "template" key.
#
# The generated sample files follow a naming convention of starting with
# "regression". The hsql variants end in "-hsql.sql".
# It is NOT advisable to try to edit these sample files directly.
# It is better to edit the original template, re-generate the sample(s),
# and re-cull the resulting "mismatches" -- being careful to cull ONLY
# mismatches that are NOT accountable to the known backend differences that
# we are working around in this way. It helps to have comments, below,
# to describe which specific issues each "regression" file is intended to
# work around.
#
# To regenerate the regression-*.sql file for a configuration, run the SQLGenerateReport.py
# tool on the report.xml file generated for that configuration, using the -f true switch,
# which will cause the successful statements to be written to stdout.
