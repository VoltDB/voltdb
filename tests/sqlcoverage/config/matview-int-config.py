# This file contains just one test suite: "joined-matview-int", which
# is a subset of those run by the (joined) "matview" sqlcoverage Jenkins
# job; it is in a separate file because it takes longer than all the
# other "matview" test suites combined.

# These tests only work when run against PostgreSQL (with or without
# PostGIS), not HSQL. Hence, to run them on the command line, use something
# like the following:
#     ant -Dpostgresql=1 -Dsql_coverage_suite=matview-int-config.py sqlcoverage
{
    # Tests of Materialized Views (of integers) defined using Joins
