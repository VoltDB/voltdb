# This file contains the "upsert" tests (and one quick joined materialized
# view test suite), which are a subset of those run by the "postgis"
# sqlcoverage Jenkins job.

# These tests only work when run against PostgreSQL, not HSQL, and some require
# PostGIS. Hence, to run them on the command line, use something like the following:
#     ant -Dpostgis=1 -Dsql_coverage_suite=postgis-upsert-jmv-config.py sqlcoverage
{
    # UPSERT tests
