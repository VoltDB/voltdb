This app is built to check if transactions are dropped, executed out of order,
or run more than once on individual partitions. It can also be used as a long
running test because data does not grow indefinitely.

The following is a list of features this app has:

- Creates a set of logical clients, each with a CID value.
- Each client gets a thread that performs synchronous operations against a
  running VoltDB server.
- Depending on the 10-mod of the CID, each thread will run SP, MP or hybrid
  transactions against replication or partitioned tables.
- All transactions run by the logical clients do the same work.
  - They add a new row id (RID) that's supplied by the client and ensure
    it's monotonically increasing.
  - They add a new counter (CNT) which is incremented from within the txn.
  - They select all data with their CID and perform a "Cheesy Checksum",
    storing the result in the table.
- A thread runs adhoc DML that changes both replicated and partitioned tables.
  The most recent entry is read and re-stored by the main procedures. This means
  the order AdHoc and regular procs run in is critical.

If a transaction is run out of order, missing or run twice, these mechanisms
should fail. This failure should be detected by:
  - Validating data in the transaction.
  - Validating data at the client logic.
  - The determisim checks built into VoltDB.
