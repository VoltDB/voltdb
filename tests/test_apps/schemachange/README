# SchemaChange app notes

This app adds a lot of data and then times how long it takes to mutate schemas.

The mutations are accomplished through one of two mechanisms, catalog update
(legacy) or ad hoc DDL. Each mechanism is implemented as a subclass of
SchemaChanger.

SchemaChanger subclasses provide methods to implement the various possible
mutations. The methods either succeed or throw IOException. The semantics of the
mechanism being used determines which methods need implementation and how
batching works. E.g. catalog updates don't need to implement drops because the
entire catalog is replaced.

Much of the intelligence for generating mutations is in the TableHelper class.
