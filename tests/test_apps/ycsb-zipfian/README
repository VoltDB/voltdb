This is the VoltDB binding for the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB). To run this benchmark, first download YCSB, which may be done as follows:

wget https://github.com/downloads/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/ycsb-0.1.4.tar.gz
tar -xfvz ycsb-0.1.4.tar.gz 

If you want to run YCSB with customized zipfian distribution workload, you can instead do:
wget https://github.com/xinjiacs/ycsb-0.1.4/releases/download/ycsb-0.1.4.1/ycsb-0.1.4-zipfian.tar.gz
tar -xf ycsb-0.1.4-zipfian.tar.gz

Next, you should set:

export YCSB_HOME="<directory where you extracted the above tarball>"

Running the client
--------------------
First, add all VoltDB server nodes in your cluster to "voltdb.servers" in base.properties. In this file, you may also tune the number of client threads to use,
as well as the number and size of fields for each key.

To preload data before running the workload, invoke run.sh with the "load" parameter. The number of keys to insert can be adjusted in load.properties.

To run a workload, first make sure that the relevant properties file exists in $YCSB_HOME/workloads. The name of this file may then be passed as the second
argument to run.sh, following the "workload" parameter. If no such parameter is provided, "workload" uses the YCSB core "workloadb" which mixes 95% reads
with 5% updates.

To run a workload, first make sure that the relevant properties file exists in $YCSB_HOME/workloads. The name of this file may then be passed as the second 
parameter to the "run" target. If no such parameter is provided, by default "workloadb" is used, which mixes 95% reads with 5% updates.

The zipfian distribution workload parameter is set as key with a double value greater than 0, by default is 0.99: zipfianconstant

Running the server
--------------------
To add a server to your cluster, invoke run.sh with the "server" parameter, passing the name of the host node as the second parameter. If no such parameter is
provided, by default "localhost" is used.
