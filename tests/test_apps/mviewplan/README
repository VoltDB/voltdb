Materialized-View Benchmark application
====================================
The purpose of this application is to provide insight on the overhead of materialized views on stored procedures.

Test currently consists of performing an adjustable amount of inserts and deletes into a table with a materialized view and 
a table without (to configure the amount of transactions to perform, adjust the txn input argument).
