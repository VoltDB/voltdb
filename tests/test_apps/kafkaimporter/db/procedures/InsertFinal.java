/*
 * Stored procedure for ExportBenchmark
 *
 * 2 tables -- all datatypes with nullable and not nullable variants
 *
 * Call the SP with DB tables insert count and export tables insert count.
 * This allows mixing DB insert to export insert ratio, following the recent
 * Flipkart customer case where export rows could exceed DB inserts as much as 10:1.
 *
 * Since DB inserts and export inserts are parameterized, it's possible to try many
 * variations in the test driver.
