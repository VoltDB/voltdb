This directory contains the source files for the performance test of live DDL CREATE and DROP.

A run.sh script is provided to run the test app. The commands to process these files are the following:

./run.sh help: show the command line parameters.
./run.sh catalog: build the catalog for the VoltDB server. It will also call Initializer to automatically generate a ddl.sql file.
./run.sh server: start a VoltDB server with the existing catalog.
./run.sh client: start a client that runs a bunch of CREATEs or DROPs to test performance.

You can set the testing parameters in run.sh script. The meanings are the following:

In function catalog
numOfTables: the number of tables that will be generated in the original ddl.sql.
numOfCols: the number of columns in each table.
numOfSPs: the number of SPs per table.
idxPercent: the percentage of UNIQUE INDEX out of the columns that will be built in each table.

In function client
servers: the comma separate list of server names.
numOfTests: the number of AdHoc DDLs that will be run in the benchmark
numOfCols: the number of columns in each AdHoc DDL.
numOfSPs: the number of SPs per table.
idxPercent: the percentage of UNIQUE INDEX out of the columns that will be built in each AdHoc DDL.
