Quick hacky description on running the long-running export test.

- Build everything:
-- If you are using eclipse build make sure zkclient jars (zkclient-0.3.jar,zookeeper-3.3.4.jar) are in classpath
-- The jars are not in repo and must be downloaded and added to classpath.
-- To add zookeeper jars in your classpath set ZKLIB to point to directory where these jars exist.
-- If running under apprunner export APPRUNNER_CLIENT_CLASSPATH="/home/opt/kafka/libs/zkclient-0.3.jar:/home/opt/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client-3.3.4.jar"
-- If running on your desktop and you have the lab home mounted locally (e.g. at /nfshome), export RBMQLIB and ZKLIB:
        export RBMQLIB=/nfshome/opt/rabbitmq
        export ZKLIB=/nfshome/opt/kafka/libs

./run.sh catalog

TO RUN remote Export Client Test:
- You'll need 3(three) terminals:

    -- In 1, run the server:
    ./run.sh server-legacy
    -- In 2, run the export client:
    ./run.sh export-tofile
    -- In 3, start the app client:
    ./run.sh async-export

TO RUN onserver Export Client Test:
- You'll need 2(two) terminals:

    -- In 1, run the server:
    ./run.sh server
    -- In 2, run the export client:
    ./run.sh async-export

TO RUN onserver Export to kafka Client Test:
- You'll need 3(three) terminals:

    -- In 1, run the server:
    ./run.sh server-kafka
    -- In 2, run the export client:
    ./run.sh async-export
    -- In 3, start the verifier client:
    ./run.sh export-kafka-server-verify

TO RUN onserver Export to RabbitMQ Client Test:
- You'll need 3(three) terminals:

    -- In 1, start the verifier client:
    ./run.sh export-rabbitmq-verify
    -- In 2, run the server:
    ./run.sh server-rabbitmq
    -- In 3, run the export client:
    ./run.sh async-export

TO RUN onserver Export Client Test with custom class:
    -- In 1, run the server:
    ./run.sh server-custom
    -- See that server comes up without any classloading issues.

TO RUN onserver Export Client to connect to JDBC (mysql):
    -- Install Mysql
    -- Make sure mysql -u root gets you mysql prompt.
    -- Create export schema by running
    mysql -u root < mysql_export.sql
    -- Copy mysql driver jar in $VOLTDB_LIB/extension/ directory
    -- Start server with mysql connector enabled.
    ./run.sh server-mysql
    -- Run the export client:
    ./run.sh async-export
    -- Verify in mysql a schema with name vexport has tables. and table has data. (TODO)

TO RUN onserver Export Client to connect to JDBC (postgresql):
    -- Install postgresql
    -- Copy postgresql driver jar in $VOLTDB_LIB/extension/ directory
    -- Start server with postgresql connector enabled.
    ./run.sh server-pg
    -- Run the export client:
    ./run.sh async-export
    -- Verify in postgresql a schema with name vexport has tables. and table has data. (TODO)
    -- Verify update catalog keeps export going. (TODO)
