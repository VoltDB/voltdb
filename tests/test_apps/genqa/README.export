Quick hacky description on running the long-running export test.

- Build everything:
./run.sh catalog

TO RUN remote Export Client Test:
- You'll need 4(four) terminals:

    -- In 1, run the server:
    ./run.sh server-legacy
    -- In 2, run the export client:
    ./run.sh export-tofile
    -- In 3, start the app client:
    ./run.sh async-export
    -- In 4, start the verifier:
    ./run.sh export-verify

TO RUN onserver Export Client Test:
- You'll need 4(four) terminals:

    -- In 1, run the server:
    ./run.sh server
    -- In 2, run the export client:
    ./run.sh async-export
    -- In 3, start the app client:
    ./run.sh export-on-server-verify

TO RUN onserver Export Client Test with custom class:
    -- In 1, run the server:
    ./run.sh server-custom
    -- See that server comes up without any classloading issues.
