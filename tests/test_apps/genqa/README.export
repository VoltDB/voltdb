Quick hacky description on running the long-running export test.

- Build everything:
./run.sh catalog

- You'll need 4(four) terminals:
-- In 1, run the server:
./run.sh server
-- In 2, run the export client:
./run.sh export
-- In 3, start the app client:
./run.sh async-export
-- In 4, start the verifier:
./run.sh export-verify
