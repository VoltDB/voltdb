This test app is to test the fix for ENG-933, where the application was crashing without a suitable error 
message when an array was passed as an input parameter to a stored procedure. Now, in this situation, an 
appropriate error message will be thrown. The method checkIfArrayType() is added to org.voltdb.VoltType and is 
called from typeFromClass in the same class.
