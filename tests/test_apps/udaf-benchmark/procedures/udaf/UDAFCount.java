/*
 * This samples uses the native asynchronous request processing protocol
 * to post requests to the VoltDB server, thus leveraging to the maximum
 * VoltDB's ability to run requests in parallel on multiple database
 * partitions, and multiple servers.
 *
 * While asynchronous processing is (marginally) more convoluted to work
 * with and not adapted to all workloads, it is the preferred interaction
 * model to VoltDB as it allows a single client with a small amount of
 * threads to flood VoltDB with requests, guaranteeing blazing throughput
 * performance.
 *
 * Note that this benchmark focuses on throughput performance and
 * not low latency performance.  This benchmark will likely 'firehose'
 * the database cluster (if the cluster is too slow or has too few CPUs)
 * and as a result, queue a significant amount of requests on the server
 * to maximize throughput measurement. To test VoltDB latency, run the
 * SyncBenchmark client, also found in the voter sample directory.
