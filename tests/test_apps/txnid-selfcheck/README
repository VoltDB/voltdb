This app is built to check if transactions are dropped or executed out of order
on individual partitions. It can also be used as a long running test because
data does not grow indefinitely.

The following is a list of features this app has:

- doTxn procedure is single partition. It inserts the current transaction ID,
  timestamp, the global row count and an arbitrary payload for a given client ID
  (cid) into the partitioned table. It checks if the last row for the same cid
  in that table was before the current transaction. This procedure also returns
  the value in the replicated table so that if this procedure and the
  multi-partition procedure are executed out of order, it will detect the error.

- updateReplicated procedure is multi-partition. It checks if other
  updateReplicated transactions were executed out of order. This procedure has
  two write batches. Some percent of this procedure calls will abort by design.

- The ratio of multi-partition transactions can be tuned by passing it to the
  client.

- The app keeps a fixed-size moving window so that data does not grow out of
  bound. The size of the window can be passed to the client.

- The client also generates payload for each single partition transaction. The
  payload size can be set when starting the client.

- To maintain ordering, the same client connection is used for a given cid.
