This benchmark client pretends to be a faux-bingo hall.

-- tournaments
CREATE TABLE T (
  T_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  DESC STRING,
  PRIMARY KEY (T_ID)
);

-- a tournament has multiple boards
-- each board stores the last round's value.
CREATE TABLE B (
 T_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
 B_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
 LAST_VALUE STRING,
 PRIMARY KEY (T_ID, B_ID)
);

-- a tournament has multiple rounds
-- maybe this table should be wider?
CREATE TABLE R (
 T_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
 R_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
 VALUE STRING NOT NULL,
 PRIMARY KEY (T_ID, R_ID)
);


There are three single partition procedures:

CreateTournament:
  insert into T
  insert boards into B

PlayRound:
   insert into R
   update last value in B for each board in this T_ID

DeleteTournament:
   delete from T where T_ID=tid
   delete from B where T_ID=tid
   delete from R where T_ID=tid.

(A transaction can be added to change rows in B where B_ID=x to
create a multi-partition transaction when/if needed.)

Client configurable parameters allow controlling the number of updates
per procedure and the number of deletes in the cleanup.

  1. Number of concurrent tournaments (default 1000)
  2. Board per tournament (B per T) (default 10)
  3. Rounds per tournament (R per T) (default 100)


Workload characterization.

Tournament creation:
1 insert plus (B per T) inserts.

Tournament round:
1 insert plus (B per T) updates.

Tournament cleanup:
1 delete plus (B per T) deletes plus (R per T) deletes.


The client code synchronizes on the tournament id. If you run with
many clients and few tournaments, there is likely going to be lock
contention in the client.  Currently, the client parameters are
constants in BingoClient.java. These could be improved to be
command line arguments from Benchmark, I suppose.
