# This file is used, together with sql-grammar.txt, to redefine (overwrite)
# certain symbols defined in that file, to their non-geospatial (ng-)
# alternative values, for use with SQLCoverage, to avoid certain issues with
# Geospatial types (point & polygon, i.e. GEOGRAPHY_POINT & GEOGRAPHY);
# namely, that their values cannot be simply compared between VoltDB and
# PostgreSQL/PostGIS, since VoltDB returns them in WKT (well-known text)
# format, whereas PostgreSQL/PostGIS uses WKB (well-known binary); also,
# currently they do not work with the Python client, which can cause
# SQLCoverage to crash.
