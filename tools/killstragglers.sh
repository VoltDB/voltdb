# kill org.voltdb processes that aren't BenchmarkController

# list all process pids and the name of the associated executable
# look for java executables
# use ps to see the command arguments for those java pids
# find args that look like an org.voltdb class main entry point
# that aren't benchmark controller
# and kill them.

# as one line:
# ps cx -o pid -o command  | grep java | awk '{print $1}' | xargs ps -w -w -o pid -o args -p | \
#  grep " org.voltdb" | grep -v BenchmarkController | awk '{print $1}'  | xargs kill -9

# a little more error friendly when no pids are found
voltdbpid=$(jps -l | grep " org.voltdb" | grep -v BenchmarkController | awk '{print $1}')
for victim in ${voltdbpid}

    kill -9 $victim
