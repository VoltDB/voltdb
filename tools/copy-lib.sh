# ENG-8472: Add both Mac and Linux native libraries to the voltdb-<rel>.jar.
#  That way, we can release a single kit, whether tarball, .deb, or .rpm that
#  contains all the binaries to run on either platform
#
# For automated builds only; harmless in a dev build but adds no value
# so enabled only in the "test" user context
