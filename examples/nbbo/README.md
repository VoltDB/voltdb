# VoltDB NBBO Example App

Use Case
--------
NBBO is the National Best Bid and Offer, defined as the lowest available ask price and highest available bid price across the participating markets for a given security.  Brokers should route trade orders to the market with the best price, and by law must guarantee customers the best available price.

This example app includes a VoltDB database schema that stores each market data tick and automatically inserts a new NBBO record whenever there is a change to the best available bid or ask price.  This can be used to serve the current NBBO or the history of NBBO changes on demand to consumers such as the dashboard or other applications.

The example includes a web dashboard that shows the real-time NBBO for a security and the latest available prices from each exchange.  It also includes a client benchmark application that generates synthetic market data ticks for all of the listed stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.  The prices are simulated using a random walk algorithm that starts from the end of day closing price that is initially read from a CSV file.  It is not intended to be a realistic simulation of market data, but simply to generate simulated data for demonstration purposes.

Quickstart
---------------------------
Make sure "bin" inside the VoltDB kit is in your PATH.  Then open a shell and go to the examples/nbbo directory, then execute the following commands to start the database:

    voltdb init
    voltdb start

Wait until you see "Server completed initialization."
Open a new shell in the same directory and run the following to load the schema:

    sqlcmd < ddl.sql

In the same shell, run the following script to preload some data and run the demo client application:

    ./run.sh client

Open up the index.html file the "web" directory to view the status dashboard.

If you're running the example on a VoltDB cluster, rather than your local desktop or laptop, run `./run.sh webserver` in a new shell on one of the machines in the cluster, then connect to your dashboard from your browser at [http://servername:8081](http://servername:8081).

You can stop the server, running client, or webserver at any time with `Ctrl-c` or `SIGINT`.  Of course VoltDB can also run in the background using the -B option, in which case you can stop it with the `voltadmin shutdown` command.

Note that the downloaded VoltDB kits include pre-compiled stored procedures and client code as jarfiles. To run the example from a source build, it may be necessary to compile the Java source code by typing "run.sh jars" before step 3 above. Note that this step requires a full Java JDK.

Using the run.sh script
---------------------------
VoltDB examples come with a run.sh shell script that simplifies compiling and running the example client application and other parts of the examples.
- *run.sh* : start the server
- *run.sh server* : start the server
- *run.sh init* : compile stored procedures and load the schema and stored procedures
- *run.sh jars* : compile all Java clients and stored procedures into two Java jarfiles
- *run.sh client* : start the client, more than 1 client is permitted
- *run.sh clean* : remove compilation and runtime artifacts
- *run.sh cleanall* : remove compilation and runtime artifacts *and* the two included jarfiles
- *run.sh webserver* : serve the web directory over http on port 8081

If you change the client or procedure Java code, you must recompile the jars by deleting them in the shell or using `./run.sh jars`.

Client Behavior Options
---------------------------
You can control various characteristics of the demo by modifying the parameters passed into the java application in the "client" function of the run.sh script.

**Speed & Duration:**

    --displayinterval=5           (seconds between status reports)
    --warmup=5                    (how long to warm up before measuring
                                   benchmark performance.)
    --duration=120                (benchmark duration in seconds)
    --ratelimit=20000             (run up to this rate of requests/second)

**Cluster Info:**

    --servers=$SERVERS            (host(s) client connect to, e.g.
                                   =localhost
                                   =localhost:21212
                                   =volt9a,volt9b,volt9c
                                   =foo.example.com:21212,bar.example.com:21212)

Customizing this Example
---------------------------
See the "deployment-examples" directory within the "examples" directory for ways to alter the default single-node, no authorization deployment style of the examples. There are readme files and example deployment XML files for different clustering, authorization, export, logging and persistence settings.
