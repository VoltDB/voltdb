/**
 * <p>Step 1. Insert given tuple.
 * Step 2. Find tuples with timestamps older than or equivalent to newestToDiscard.
 * Delete up to maxRowsToDeletePerProc of them, in oldest to newest order.</p>
 *
 * <p>This procedure basically combines TIMEDATA.insert with DeleteAfterDate.</p>
 *
 * <p>One important thing to consider when developing procedures like this is
 * that they be deterministic. This procedure may be applied simultaniously on
 * many replica partitions, but since it will deterministically delete the same
 * tuples if the database contents are identical, then it will be fine. Note:
 * this is why VoltDB doesn't allow LIMIT in delete operators. All DML must
 * be deterministic.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note, there is a lot of redundant code/comments among the stored procedures
 * in this example app. That's intentional to make each stand alone and be easier
 * to follow. A production app might offer less choice or just reuse more code.</p>
