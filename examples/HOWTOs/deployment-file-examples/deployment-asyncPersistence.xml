    This deployment file config will asynchronously
    write transactions to disk, allowing for only a small
    window of lost transactions if there is a global
    cluster failure.

    The frequency parameter here says to ensure data is
    fsynced to disk every 200ms or 500 individual transactions,
    whichever comes first. This will cause backpressure if the
    target disk can't keep up with the write rate or the fsync
    rate, but it will bound lost transactions in the event of
    a global failure.
