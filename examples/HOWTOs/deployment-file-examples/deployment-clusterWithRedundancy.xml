    By default, a voltdb cluster has no redundant copies
    of the data (kfactor="0"). If any node crashes, the cluster
    will crash.  The cluster can have higher availability by
    storing copies of the data on multiple nodes.
    

    kfactor="1" creates 2 copies of the data among the nodes (you
    must use at least kfactor + 1 nodes in your cluster).

    Init a voltdbroot on each node with
      voltdb init -C deployment-clusterWithRedundancy.xml

    Start the cluster by typing on each node:
      voltdb start -c $nodecount -H $comma-separated-nodelist
    For example a 3 node cluster start command would be:
      voltdb start -c 3 -H node1,node2,node3
