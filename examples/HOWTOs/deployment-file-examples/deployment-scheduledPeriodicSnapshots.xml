    This deployment file config will attempt to
    write a full disk snapshot cluster-wide every
    30 minutes. It will keep 3 snapshots and delete
    old snapshots on a rotating basis.

    Note if you are using command logging, these
    snapshots are in addition to periodic truncation
    snapshots.
