    n3k1 means 3 nodes and k=1 (double redundancy)

    Adding hostcount="3" to the cluster element means
    we have a 3-node cluster.

    Adding kfactor="1" to the cluster element means
    we have a k=1 (double redundancy) cluster.

    Start the cluster using:
      voltdb create -d path/to/deployment-n3k1.xml -H $LEADER_HOST_OR_IP
    where $LEADER_HOST_OR_IP is the same for all nodes joining
    the cluster.
