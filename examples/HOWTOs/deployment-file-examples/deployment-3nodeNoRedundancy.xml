    n3k0 means 3 nodes and k=0 (no redundancy)

    Adding hostcount="3" to the cluster element means
    we have a 3-node cluster.

    Adding kfactor="0" to the cluster element means
    we have a k=0 (no redundancy) cluster.
    Note this is the default value for this attribute and
    it can be ommitted.

    Start the cluster using:
      voltdb create -d path/to/deployment-n3k0.xml -H $LEADER_HOST_OR_IP
    where $LEADER_HOST_OR_IP is the same for all nodes joining
    the cluster.
