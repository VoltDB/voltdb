# VoltDB Example App: Position Keeper

Use Case
--------
This application simulates a simple position keeper application that maintains portfolio positions. Portfolios are updated frequently as trades and price changes occur.

Quickstart
---------------------------
Make sure "bin" inside the VoltDB kit is in your PATH.  Then open a shell and go to the examples/positionkeeper directory, then execute the following commands to start the database:

    voltdb init
    voltdb start

Wait until you see "Server completed initialization."
Open a new shell in the same directory and run the following to load the schema:

    sqlcmd < ddl.sql

In the same shell, run the following script to preload some data and run the demo client application:

    ./run.sh client

You can stop the server or running client at any time with `ctrl-c` or `SIGINT`.  Of course VoltDB can also run in the background using the -B option, in which case you can stop it with the `voltadmin shutdown` command.

Note that the downloaded VoltDB kits include pre-compiled stored procedures and client code as jarfiles. To run the example from a source build, it may be necessary to compile the Java source code by typing "run.sh jars" before step 3 above. Note that this step requires a full Java JDK.

Using the run.sh script
---------------------------
VoltDB examples come with a run.sh shell script that simplifies compiling and running the example client application and other parts of the examples.
- *run.sh* : start the server
- *run.sh server* : start the server
- *run.sh init* : compile stored procedures and load the schema and stored procedures
- *run.sh jars* : compile all Java clients and stored procedures into two Java jarfiles
- *run.sh client* : start the client, more than 1 client is permitted
- *run.sh clean* : remove compilation and runtime artifacts
- *run.sh cleanall* : remove compilation and runtime artifacts *and* the two included jarfiles

If you change the client or procedure Java code, you must recompile the jars by deleting them in the shell or using `./run.sh jars`.

Client Behavior Options
---------------------------
You can control various characteristics of the demo by modifying the parameters passed into the java application in the "client" function of the run.sh script.

**Speed & Duration:**

    --displayinterval=5           (seconds between status reports)
    --warmup=5                    (how long to warm up before measuring
                                   benchmark performance.)
    --duration=120                (benchmark duration in seconds)
    --ratelimit=20000             (run up to this rate of requests/second)

**Cluster Info:**

    --servers=$SERVERS            (host(s) client connect to, e.g.
                                   =localhost
                                   =localhost:21212
                                   =volt9a,volt9b,volt9c
                                   =foo.example.com:21212,bar.example.com:21212)

**Parameters Affecting Simulation:**

    --traders=1000                (number of traders)
    --secpercnt=10                (number of securities each trader has in their portfolio)

Customizing this Example
---------------------------
See the "deployment-examples" directory within the "examples/HOWTOs" directory for ways to alter the default single-node, no authorization deployment style of the examples. There are readme files and example deployment XML files for different clustering, authorization, export, logging and persistence settings.
