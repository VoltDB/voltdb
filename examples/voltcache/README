Volt Cache application
===========================

This example application demonstrates how to create a Memcache-like cache in VoltDB. It provides a sample protocol transalation between VoltCache and Memcached, allowing client applications using a Memcached client to run on VoltCache without any code change (Text Protocol only).

Many attributes of the application are customizable through arguments passed to the client, including:

  - How long the sample client runs
  - When to start recording performance statistics
  - How frequently to report those statistics
  - "Key" size
  - Minimum and Maximum "Value" size (Value sizes will be randomly distributed between min and max)
  - Percentage of transactions that are "Gets" (out of 100%, the rest are "Puts")
  - Store the "Value" as is (text), or compress the "Value" (compressible binary)

These attributes can be adjusted by modifying the arguments to the "benchmark" target in the run.sh script.

Logging
------------------------------------------------

This application supports logging using log4j and is delivered with log4j configuration files for both the client (log-client.xml) and server (log-server.xml).


Interpreting the Results
------------------------

While the "Volt Cache" application is designed with benchmarking in mind, it is essentially a network-bound application: you will generally find that you max-out your network bandwidth long before you reach "impressive" pure database throughput (TPS) numbers.

For a better feel for the type of performance VoltDB is capable of on your hardware, check out the "Voter" application sample.

run.sh actions described
---------------------

run.sh                : compile all Java clients and stored procedures, build the catalog, and start the server

run.sh srccompile     : compile all Java clients and stored procedures

run.sh server         : start the server

run.sh client         : start the client, [if needed, initialize the given number of key-value pairs (puts),] begin normal client processing (gets and puts)

run.sh catalog        : compile sources and build the catalog

run.sh clean             : remove compiled files
