/**
 * This subclass of VoltProcedure is invoked when simulating a request
 * from a mobile device for an ad.  Given the location of the device,
 * it finds the bid with the highest dollar amount where the device is within
 * the ad's bid region, and the current time is within the bids start
 * and end parameters
 *
 * It also updates the historical table ad_requests with info on the winning
 * bid (if any---nulls are added to the ad_requests row for ad requests that
 * are not met).
 *
 * The bid id for the successful bid is returned, or -1 if no such bids exist.
 *
 * This is a single-partition stored procedure, so it can execute on many sites
 * in parallel.
