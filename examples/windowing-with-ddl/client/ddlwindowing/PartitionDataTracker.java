/**
 * <p>Runnable-implementor that fetches some per-partition information
 * from a running VoltDB procedure using VoltDB system procedures.
 * First, it uses "@GetPartitionKeys" to get a value that will partition
 * to each partition (used for targeting single-partition procedure call).
 * Then it uses "@Statistics" with the "TABLE" selector to get the number
 * of tuples in the 'timedata' table at each partition.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every time that it's called, it updates a global data structure. This
 * structure is primarily used by Reporter to log per-partition statistics.</p>
 *
 * <p>This code is pretty adaptable to other applications without much
 * modification.</p>
