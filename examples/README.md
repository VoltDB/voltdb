Example Projects
--------------------------

The following projects are included in the examples directory:

### geospatial ###
  This example demonstrates geospatial functionality that was added
  to VoltDB in version 6.0.  The problem space for this demo is
  serving ads to many mobile device users based on their location
  in real time.

### json-sessions ####
  This example shows how to use flexible schema and JSON within
  a VoltDB application.

### uniquedevices ###
  This example counts unique device ids as they stream into VoltDB. It
  demonstrates VoltDB's stream processing power and the use of external
  libraries in Java stored procedures. It is loosely based on a real problem
  previously solved using the Lambda architecture.

### voltkv ###
  This directory contains the sources for the "Key-Value" implementation
  in VoltDB.

### voter ###
  This example is a simulation of a telephone based voting process
  where callers are allowed a limited number of votes.

### windowing ###
  This example shows an application that takes in time-series data,
  runs analytic queries over several time-windows, and deletes older
  data as it either ages out or passes a rowcount threshold.
  
### windowing-with-ddl ###
  A modified version of the windowing example that demonstrates the
  V5 feature that lets users define how to age out old tuples using
  a special constraint on the table definition.  This example has no
  Java stored procedures.
Getting Started
--------------------------

Each example contains a README.md file with full instructions for running, building, etc.

The examples all contain a bash script file named "run.sh" that contains functions for doing most things. This is generally only strictly needed for running the client apps, but can be a useful reference for other operations.

The following steps will run an example:

1. Make sure "bin" inside the VoltDB kit is in your path.
2. Type "voltdb create &" to start an empty, single-node VoltDB server.
3. Type "sqlcmd < ddl.sql" to load the schema and the jarfile of procedures into VoltDB.
4. Type "./run.sh client" to run the client code.

Typing "./run.sh help" will also show the available targets for each example.

When finished, hit Ctrl C in the server terminal window to stop the VoltDB database.
