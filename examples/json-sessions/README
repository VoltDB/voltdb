JSON application
===========================

This samples demonstrates how to use VoltDB JSON functions to implement a flexible 
schema-type of application.  The application demonstrated here is a single sign-on 
session tracking application.  Logins from multiple sites (URLs) are tracked in a 
user session table in VoltDB.  Each login has common fields such as username and 
global session id.  Further, each login has site-specific data stored in a varchar 
column as JSON data.


---------------------

The main goal of the JSON application is to demonstrate flexible schema and JSON
support in VoltDB:

- This sample application uses the VoltDB synchronous API to load the database.

- The sample first creates 10 threads and loads up as many random logins as possible
in 10 seconds.  The insertion rate (tx/second) and latency is calculated and displayed.

- Once the data is loaded, the sample application executes a series of
AdHoc SQL queries, demonstrating various SQL queries on the JSON data.


run.sh actions
-----------

run.sh               : compile the Java client and stored procedure, build the 
                       catalog, and start the server

run.sh srccompile    : compile all Java clients and stored procedures

run.sh server        : start the server

run.sh client        : start the client, more than 1 client is permitted

run.sh catalog       : build the catalog

run.sh clean         : remove compiled files
