/**
 * Java implementation of HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm from this paper:
 * <p/>
 * http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf
 * <p/>
 * HLL is an improved version of LogLog that is capable of estimating
 * the cardinality of a set with accuracy = 1.04/sqrt(m) where
 * m = 2^b.  So we can control accuracy vs space usage by increasing
 * or decreasing b.
 * <p/>
 * The main benefit of using HLL over LL is that it only requires 64%
 * of the space that LL does to get the same accuracy.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation implements a single counter.  If a large (millions)
 * number of counters are required you may want to refer to:
 * <p/>
 * http://dsiutils.dsi.unimi.it/
 * <p/>
 * It has a more complex implementation of HLL that supports multiple counters
 * in a single object, drastically reducing the java overhead from creating
 * a large number of objects.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation leveraged a javascript implementation that Yammer has
 * been working on:
 * <p/>
 * https://github.com/yammer/probablyjs
 * <p>
 * Note that this implementation does not include the long range correction function
 * defined in the original paper.  Empirical evidence shows that the correction
 * function causes more harm than good.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Users have different motivations to use different types of hashing functions.
 * Rather than try to keep up with all available hash functions and to remove
 * the concern of causing future binary incompatibilities this class allows clients
 * to offer the value in hashed int or long form.  This way clients are free
 * to change their hash function on their own time line.  We recommend using Google's
 * Guava Murmur3_128 implementation as it provides good performance and speed when
 * high precision is required.  In our tests the 32bit MurmurHash function included
 * in this project is faster and produces better results than the 32 bit murmur3
 * implementation google provides.
 * </p>
