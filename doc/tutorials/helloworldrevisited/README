This directory contains the source files for the revised Hello, World! example described in the VoltDB Performance Guide (doc/PerfGuide.pdf).

The tutorial is designed to demonstrate coding practices that can maximize your use of VoltDB. A shell script (run.sh) is provided to help build and run the example. To run the example, use the following commands:

        ./run.sh &        — create the database
        ./run.sh init     — load the schema and stored procedures
        ./run.sh client   — run the client application
