     *
     * <p>The id consists of a time based component in the most significant bits followed
     * by a counter, and then a partition id to allow parallel unique number generation.</p>
     *
     * <p>Currently, if the host clock moves backwards this call may block while the clock
     * catches up to its previous max. Running NTP with the -x option will prevent this in
     * most cases. It may not be sufficient to 100% avoid this, especially in managed and/or
     * virtualized environments (like AWS). The value will always be unique, but clocks moving
     * backwards may affect system throughput.</p>
     *
     * <p>Since this number is initially based on the wall clock time (UTC), it is not
     * guaranteed to be unique across different clusters of VoltDB. If you snapshot, then
     * move time back by 1HR, then load that snapshot into a new VoltDB cluster, you might
     * see duplicate ids for up to 1HR. Since the wall clocks VoltDB uses are UTC, and it
     * takes some amount of time to snapshot and restore, this is a pretty easy corner case
     * to avoid. Note that failure and recovery from disk using command logs will preserve
     * unique id continuity even if the clock shifts.</p>
     *
     * <p>In many cases it may make sense to generate unique ids on the client-side and pass
     * them to the server. Please reach out to VoltDB if you have questions about when using
     * this method is appropriate.</p>
