// Some comments on threading and organization.
//   start() returns a future. Block on this future to get the final answer.
//
//   deliver() runs in the initiator mailbox deliver() context and triggers
//   all repair work.
//
//   it is important that repair work happens with the deliver lock held
//   and that updatereplicas also holds this lock -- replica failure during
//   repair must happen unambiguously before or after each local repair action.
//
//   A RepairAlgo can only be cancelled by initiator mailbox while the deliver
//   lock is held. Repair work must check for cancellation before producing
//   repair actions to the mailbox.
//
//   Note that a RepairAlgo can not prevent messages being delivered post
//   cancellation.  RepairLog requests therefore use a requestId to
//   disambiguate responses for cancelled requests that are filtering in late.
