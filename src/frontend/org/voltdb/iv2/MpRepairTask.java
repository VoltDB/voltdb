/**
 * This task runs on the MPI's site threads after a topology change which doesn't
 * kill the current master MPI.
 *
 * Must run the repair while pausing the site task queue;
 * Otherwise, a new MP might immediately be blocked in a
 * confused world of semi-repair. So just do the repair
 * work on the site thread....
 *
 * When repairing while the MPI is executing concurrent reads,
 * we need to ensure that the full repair algorithm only runs on one of
 * the in-use RO MPI site threads.  That site will perform all of the message collection
 * and delivery.  All of the other MP RO sites need to block at this point.
