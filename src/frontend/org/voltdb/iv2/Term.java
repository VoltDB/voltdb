//   replica change handler runs in the zookeeper watch thread context.
//   replica change handler invokes a method in init.mbox that also
//   takes the init.mbox deliver lock
//
//   it is important that repair work happens with the deliver lock held
//   and that updatereplicas also holds this lock -- replica failure during
//   repair must happen unambigously before or after each local repair action.
