/**
 * Orders work for command log replay - where fragment tasks can show up before
 * or after the partition-wise sentinels that record the correct location of a
 * multi-partition work in the partition's transaction sequence.
 *
 * Offer a message to the replay sequencer. If the sequencer rejects this
 * message, it is already correctly sequenced. Callers must check the return
 * code of <code>offer</code>. If offering makes other messages available, they
 * must be retrieved by calling poll() until it returns null.
 *
 * End of log handling: If the local partition reaches end of log first, all MPs
 * blocked waiting for sentinels will be made safe, future MP fragments will
 * also be safe automatically. If the MPI reaches end of log first, and there is
 * an outstanding sentinel in the sequencer, then all SPs blocked after this
 * sentinel will be made safe (can be polled). There cannot be any fragments in
 * the replay sequencer when the MPI EOL arrives, because the MPI will only send
 * EOLs when it has finished all previous MP work. NOTE: Once MPI end of log
 * message is received, NONE of the SPs polled from the sequencer can be
 * executed, the poller must make sure that a failure response is returned
 * appropriately instead. However, SPs rejected by offer() can always be
 * executed.
 *
 * NOTE: messages are sequenced according to the transactionId passed in to the
 * offer() method. This transaction id may differ from the value stored in the
 * ReplayEntry.m_firstFragment in the case of DR fragment tasks. The
 * ReplaySequencer MUST do all txnId comparisons on the value passed to offer
 * (which becomes a key in m_replayEntries tree map).
