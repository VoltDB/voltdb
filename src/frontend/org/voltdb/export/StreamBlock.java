/*
 * The stream block has a default reference count of 1 for being in the queue.
 * It acquires another if it is handed of for processing in another thread.
 *
 * This prevents the memory from being deallocated when the data is pushed to disk
 * as part of a sync. In those scenarios we let the processing thread deallocate
 * when it is finished, and the ack will handle deleting the persisted version of the block.
 *
 * For buffers that are disk backed they won't go through that
 * transition without the coop of the processor so there is no race.
 *
 * There are basically two schemes for tracking data, reference counting for managing allocations
 * and acking for the logical stream data and they serve different purposes. Acking determines
 * when the data needs to go away. Reference counting is just there to gracefully handle data being
 * pushed to disk while it is being processed.
 *
 * Interactions with disk based data are serialized through the ExportDataSource thread while
 * freeing the memory can be done safely from either thread because the allocator is concurrent.
