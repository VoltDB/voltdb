/**
 * StmtTableScan caches data related to a given instance of a table or a sub-query
 * within the statement scope.  These are the items we scan over in a FROM clause.
 * For example, given this SQL statement:
 *   select * from a, b as bb join b as cc on bb.id = cc.id;
 * there are three table scans.  One is for a, with alias a.
 * There is a second for bb with alias b, and a third for
 * b again, but with alias cc.  These two occurrences of b
 * are separate scans of the same table.
 *
 * In a certain sense, these scans are similar to a <em>scope<em>
 * in other programming languages.  Given a table reference, T.C,
 * we look up the name T in parsed statement to find which StmtTableScan
 * it denotes, and then we look up C in the scan.
 *
 * There are separate subclasses of this class for persistent
 * tables and for ephemeral tables, whose values don't persist
 * past a single query.
 *
 * There is some complexity here with names.  At the core of a
 * StmtTableScan object there is a NodeSchema.  This is a list
 * of SchemaColumn objects.  Each column has a name, but columns
 * may not be uniquely determined by their name.  For example,
 * in a derived table which joins two other derived tables there
 * may be some name duplication.  In order to keep these all
 * straight we introduce another integer index, thie differentiator.
 * Two schema columns must have different <name, differentiator>
 * pairs.
