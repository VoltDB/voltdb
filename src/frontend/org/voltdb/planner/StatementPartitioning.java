/**
 * Represents the partitioning of the data underlying a statement.
 * In the simplest case, this is pre-determined by the single-partition context of the statement
 * from a stored procedure annotation or a single-statement procedure attribute.
 * In the more interesting ad hoc case, a user can specify that a statement be run on all partitions,
 * but the semantics of the statement may indicate that the same result could be produced more optimally
 * by running it on a single partition selected based on the hash of some partition key value,
 * whether a statement parameter or a constant in the text of the statement.
 * These cases arise both in queries and in (partitioned table) DML.
 * As a multi-partition statement is analyzed in the planner, this object is filled in with details
 * regarding its suitability for running correctly on a single partition.
 *
 * For a multi-fragment plan that contains a join,
 * is it better to send partitioned tuples and join them on the coordinator
 * or is it better to join them before sending?
 * If bandwidth (or capacity of the receiving temp table) were the primary concern,
 * a decision could be based on
 * A) how much wider the joined rows are than the pre-joined rows.
 * B) the expected yield of the join filtering -- does each pre-joined row typically
 *    match and get joined with multiple partner rows or does it typically fail to match
 *    any row.
 * The statistics required to determine "B" are not generally available.
 * In any case, there are two over-arching concerns.
 * One is the correct handling of a special case
 * -- a join of partitioned tables on their partition keys.
 * In this case, the join MUST happen on each partition prior to sending any tuples.
 * This restriction stems directly from the limitation that there can only be two fragments in a plan,
 * and that a fragment produces a single (intermediate or final) result table.
 * The "coordinator" receives the (one) intermediate result table and produces
 * the final result table. It can not receive tuples from two different partitioned tables.
 * The second over-arching consideration is that there is an optimization available to the
 * transaction processor for the special case in which a coordinator fragment does not need to
 * access any persistent local data (I learned this second hand from Izzy. --paul).
 * This provides further motivation to do all scanning and joining in the collector fragment
 * prior to sending tuples.
 *
 * These two considerations normally override all others,
 * so that all multi-partition plans only "send after all joins", regardless of bandwidth/capacity
 * considerations, but there remains some edge cases in which the decision MUST go the other way,
 * that is, sending tuples prior to joining on the coordinator.
 * This occurs for some OUTER JOINS between a replicated OUTER table and a partitioned INNER table as in:
 *
 * SELECT * FROM replicated R LEFT JOIN partitioned P ON ...;
 *
 * See the comment in SelectSubPlanAssembler.getSelectSubPlanForJoin
