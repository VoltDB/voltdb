 * from a stored procedure annotation or a single-statement procedure attribute,
 * or implied by the presence of a partition key value for an ad hoc query.
 * In the more interesting case, a user can specify that a statement be run on all partitions,
 * but the semantics of the statement may indicate that the same result could be produced more optimally
 * by running it on a single partition based on some partition key, whether a statement parameter or a constant in the
 * text of the statement.
 * These cases arise both in queries and in (partitioned table) DML.
 * As a multi-partition statement is analyzed in the planner, this object is filled in with details regarding its
 * suitability for running correctly on a single partition.
