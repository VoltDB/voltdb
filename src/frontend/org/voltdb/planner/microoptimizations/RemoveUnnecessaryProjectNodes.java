     * Sometimes when a plan is a single partition plan we end up
     * with an extra, unnecessary projection node.  We can't actually
     * easily remove this in the planner.  The projection node occurs
     * when:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>We push a RECEIVE/SEND pair onto a subplan.  This subplan
     *       would be a join tree or scan, or maybe a subquery.</li>
     *   <li>We push a projection node on top of the R/S pair to calculate
     *       the select list expressions.</li>
     *   <li>We decide the plan is a single partition plan anyway, and
     *       that the R/S pair is not really needed after all.  So, we
     *       eliminate the pair.</li>
     * </ol>
     * At none of these steps do we have enough information to know if
     * the projection node is needed or if it can be eliminated.  So
     * we need to look for these unnecessary projection nodes after
     * the plans are constructed, which means we need a micro-optimization.
     *
     * Now, we can't apply a microoptimization as we usually do, while selecting
     * the best plan, because the output schemas have not been generated
     * when the microoptimizations are being applied.  So we need a
     * special microoptimization which is applied after the plan is
     * in its final state.
