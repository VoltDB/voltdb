/**
 * Class that aids in the tracking of a VoltDB node state.
 *
 * As well as the actual node state, this class supports
 * progress indication (represented as 'N things complete
 * out of a total of M') and a set-once flag that marks
 * the point at which VoltDB considers startup to be
 * complete.
 *
 * These are both for the convenience of status reporing
 * via an API that calls StatusServlet. It is the case
 * that a node state of UP does not always indicate that
 * we are ready to service client requests; and we have
 * both a progress indicator and an explicit completion
 * flag because of the somewhat ad-hoc way we track our
 * progress. The flag has the final say as to whether
 * startup has completed.
 *
 * Warning: since some code paths are used for startup
 * and during normal operations, the 'progress' data
 * may not reflect anything useful after the startup
 * completion flag is set.
