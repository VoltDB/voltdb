<h2>Java Native Interfaces of C++ Execution Engine.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
VoltDB mainly consists of Java modules for easier development.
However, the core EE and its underlying on-memory storage system is
implemented in C++. Nowadays Java and C++ have almost same performance
for many cases, but C++ still outperforms Java on low-level memory accesses.
This is why we have EE and its storage system written in C++.

The Java native interface works as a bridge between Java modules and C++ EE.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Files and Compilation</h3>
<p>The JNI entry points are defined in:</p>
<p><b>build/trunk/MIT_ACR/EE/src/hstorejni.cpp</b></p>
<p>which includes the JNI skeleton header file:</p>
<p><b>build/trunk/MIT_ACR/EE/src/org_voltdb_jni_ExecutionEngine.h</b></p>
<p>output by JDK's <i>javah</i> command on:</p>
<p><b>build/trunk/GPL_VCR/gpl_java/gpl_src/org/voltdb/jni/ExecutionEngine.java</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The <b>org.voltdb.jni.ExecutionEngine</b> Java class also defines
several public static final constant values exported to C++ side by javah
command. The compilation does following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Compile Java classes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute javah on the class files to refresh JNI skeleton header</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compile C++ files</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Link object files to a native shared library</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>The name of JNI shared library is "<b>voltdb" </b>(VoltDB Execution Engine)
and the actual library file compiled by GCC is named "<b>libvoltdb.so</b>"
in Linux, "<b>libvoltdb.jnilib</b>" in MacOSX and so on, depending on the default
 prefix and extension of shared library on the platform.
  See <b>MIT_ACR/EE/platform/platform-XXX-defines.mk</b> and
   <b>MIT_ACR/EE/src/makefile</b> for more details about compile/link options.</p>
<p>In anyway, the library is loaded to JVM in ExecutionEngine Java class by the name "voltdb".</p>

<hr />
<h3>Basic Rules</h3>
<p>An ExecutionEngine Java object corresponds to an HStoreEngine C++ object
defined in MIT_ACR/EE/src/execution/hstoreengine.h, cpp. Each method
in ExecutionEngine Java class has corresponding method in HStoreEngine C++
class and its JNI interface in hstorejni.cpp.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To make JNI method calls simple and fast, all JNI methods should
satisfy 3 rules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. First parameter should be the EE pointer.</p>
<p>hstorejni.cpp is designed to be stateless. It uses no local or global
 variables in it. Instead, <b>nativeCreate()</b> method creates
 HStoreEngine C++ object and returns the pointer to Java as a
 <i>jlong</i> value. ExecutionEngine Java object holds the pointer
 value until the Java object is released and passes it to JNI methods
 each time. By this way, multiple C++ EE instances in same shared
 library space can simultaneously work without any conflict between them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Return value should be an error code.</p>
<p>For portability, the JNI methods don't throw exceptions. Instead,
they return <i>jint</i> value as an error code defined in ExecutionEngine.
 ExecutionEngine converts the error code to RuntimeException and appropriate
 message and throws it in Java side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Parameters and return values should be in primitive types</p>
<p>They should be simple primitive values or arrays of primitive types.
Java.lang.String is also used, but only in the case where the characters
are guaranteed to be in US-ASCII charset.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only exception of above rule is <b>nativeSerializeTable()</b>,
which returns the whole content of a table stored in C++ EE.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, for type-safety, the public Java method receives objects, not
primitive values. See the class comment of
<a href="ExecutionEngine.html">ExecutionEngine</a> for more details.</p>
