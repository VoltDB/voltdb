VoltDB Web Studio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VoltDB Web Studio is a standalone web application for browsing VoltDB databases.
Studio uses a tree view to display the database schema and available stored
procedures. In a separate pane, you can enter and execute SQL statements against
the database, or see performance metrics concerning the latency, transaction rate,
and memory usage of the database.

To use VoltDB Web Studio, simply open the index.htm file in a modern web browser.
Once the Studio Web opens, you can connect to one or more databases, view the
schema, enter SQL statements and view charts using a set of control buttons
that run along the top of the browser window.

The following sections provide more detail on using Studio Web.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ VoltDB Web Studio requires an HTML 5-compatible web browser, such as
  Firefox 3.6, Safari 5.0, Chrome 12, Internet Explorer 9 or above.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using VoltDB Web Studio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schema Browsing ----------------------------------------------------------------

+ All schema information is available for browsing in the tree control on the
  left side of the application window.


Executing SQL Statements --------------------------------------------------------

+ After connecting to a VoltDB database, open an SQL Query Window by
  clicking the New Query button, pressing CTRL+N, or right-clicking on the
  connection name in the tree view and selecting "New Query" from the context menu.

+ Enter valid VoltDB SQL (select, insert, update, delete) in the Query Window.

+ Execute the Query by pressing the Execute Query button (or pressing F5).
  + Results and any messages are displayed below the SQL Query Window.
  + The output format can be changed pressing one of the Result Type buttons:
    csv, tab, fix, or grid. (The default output format is grid.)


Running Stored Procedures ------------------------------------------------------

+ VoltDB Web Studio supports executing stored procedures defined in the database
  catalog.

+ You can execute stored procedures by issuing an EXECUTE command in the
  SQL Query window. The syntax of the EXECUTE command is:

  exec(ute) <procedure-name> [<param-1> [,<param-2> [,param-n]]]

+ Samples from the "Voter" example application:
  + exec Results
  + exec Vote 5055555555, 2, 10


Monitoring Server Performance --------------------------------------------------

+ VoltDB Web Studio allows monitoring of memory usage (GB in use by VoltDB on all
  servers in the cluster) as well as average transaction latency (within the
  server) and overall transactional throughput.
+ To open a monitor window click the Performance Monitor button, press F3, or
  right-click on the connection in the tree view and select "Performance Monitor"
  from the context menu.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Issues / Limitations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ The application gathers schema information immediately after connecting to the
  cluster.  Tables with a large number of rows will fail the column name / data
  type check and show "Schema could not be read..." in the user interface.
+ Studio Web executes SQL statements as ad-hoc queries using the @AdHoc system
  procedure. Ad hoc queries may be constrained as to how much data can be 
  selected, aggregated, sorted, and returned. If these constraints are violated,
  the query will fail and report an error in the "Messages" tab.
