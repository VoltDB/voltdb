     *            processed, at which point the server will disconnect the application, thinking it
     *            died and is not reading responses as fast as it is pushing requests. When the flag

     *            work, thus preventing server fire-hosing. In some cases however, with very fast,
     *            small transactions, this limit can be raised.
