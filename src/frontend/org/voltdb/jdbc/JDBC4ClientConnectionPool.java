 * management of those connections (releasing resources, etc.).

     * @param password
     *            the password to use when connecting to the server(s).
     * @param isHeavyWeight
     *            the flag indicating callback processes on this connection will be heavy (long
     *            running callbacks). By default the connection only allocates one background
     *            processing thread to process callbacks. If those callbacks run for a long time,
     *            the network stack can get clogged with pending responses that have yet to be
     *            processed, at which point the server will disconnect the application, thinking it
     *            died and is not reading responses as fast as it is pushing requests. When the flag
     *            is set to 'true', an additional 2 processing thread will deal with processing
     *            callbacks, thus mitigating the issue.
     * @param maxOutstandingTxns
     *            the number of transactions the client application may push against a specific
     *            connection before getting blocked on back-pressure. By default the connection
     *            allows 3,000 open transactions before preventing the client from posting more
     *            work, thus preventing server fire-hosing. In some cases however, with very fast,
     *            small transactions, this limit can be raised.
     * @param reconnectOnConnectionLoss
     *            Attempts to reconnect to a node with retry after connection loss
     * @return the client connection object the caller should use to post requests.
