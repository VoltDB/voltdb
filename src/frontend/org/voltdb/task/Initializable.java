/**
 * Base interface for all interfaces of classes which are supplied to the {@link TaskManager} for construction and
 * initialization
 * <p>
 * An initializable instance can have external parameters supplied by the DDL. If an initializable needs to have
 * parameters passed in it is done through a {@code public void initialize} method. Only valid column types are allowed
 * as initialize parameters with two exceptions. The first one being that the first argument may be an instance of
 * {@link TaskHelper}, but this is optional. The other exception is that the last parameter can be either
 * {@code String[]} or {@code Object[]}. If the last parameter is an array then it will be treated as a var args
 * parameter.
 * <p>
 * Example initialize methods:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void initialize(int interval, String timeUnit)
 * public void initialize(TaskHelper helper, int interval, String timeUnit)
 * public void initialize(int interval, String timeUnit, String procedureName, Object... procedureParameters)
 * public void initialize(TaskHelper helper, int interval, String timeUnit, String procedureName, Object... procedureParameters)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Optionally an implementation can implement a {@code validateParameters} method which will be invoked during the DDL
 * validation phase. All parameters must match exactly the type of parameters passed to the initialize method of the
 * Scheduler implementation. The return of {@code validateParameters} must be a {@link String} which is {@code null} if
 * no error is detected otherwise an appropriate error message should be returned.
