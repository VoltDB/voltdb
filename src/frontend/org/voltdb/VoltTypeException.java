 * A volt-specific exception to be thrown when some flavor of unresolvable
 * type issue occurs (mismatched type, bad cast, cast leading to over/underflow,
 * etc.).  We'll probably eventually want things more specialized than this to
 * signal various SQL-mandated error conditions(?) but this hopefully is at
 * least incrementally better than throwing generic java exceptions in such
