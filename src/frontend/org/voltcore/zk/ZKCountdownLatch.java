/**
 * A minimal countdown latch implementation that is not particularly scalable
 * nor good at cleaning up after itself. However it is fine for once per cluster type barriers
 * at startup although preferably it shouldn't be used in the common case where it would slow down unit
 * test startup.
 *
 * Initially created for a barrier after command logs are initialized and CL isn't on in most unit tests
