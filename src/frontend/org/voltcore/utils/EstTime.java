/**
 * A class for retrieving an estimated indication of the current time.
 * Very fast since the field is updated less frequently and only updated occasionally.
 * Should be cachable by the CPU and the cache will only be invalidated when it is updated.
 * Thanks MESI!
 *
 * CAVEAT The time is not guaranteed to always increase (can move backwards) if there
 * are multiple VoltNetwork's present in the process.
