/**
 * LockFile variant that capitalizes upon the availability of
 * {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock FileLock}. <p>
 *
 * <b>Configuration</b>:<p>
 *
 * To enable POSIX mandatory file lock tagging, set the system property
 * {@link #POSIX_MANDITORY_FILELOCK_PROPERTY} true. <p>
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * <b><em>Windows</em><sup>tm</sup> File Locking Notes</b>:<p>
 *
 * There are two major differences between Unix and Windows locking.<p>
 *
 * First, <em>Windows</em><sup>tm</sup> supports a share reservation programming
 * interface. Share reservations apply to the entire file and are specified at
 * the time a file is created or opened. A share reservation consists of a pair
 * of modes. The first is the access mode, which is how the application will
 * access the file: read, write, or read/write. The second is the access
 * that the application will deny to other applications: none, read, write,
 * or read/write. When the application attempts to open a file, the operating
 * system checks to see if there are any other open requests on the file. If so,
 * it first compares the application's access mode with the deny mode of the
 * other openers. If there is a match, then the open is denied. If not, then
 * the operating system compares the application's deny mode with the access
 * mode of the other openers. Again, if there is a match, the open is denied.<p>
 *
 * Second, there is no advisory locking under <em>Windows</em>. Whole file
 * locking, byte range locking, and share reservation locking are all
 * mandatory. <p>
 *
 * As a side note, research indicates that very few <em>Windows</em> programs
 * actually rely on byte range mandatory locking. <p>
 *
 * <b>POSIX File Locking Notes</b>:<p>
 *
 * There are three commonly found locking functions under POSIX - flock, lockf,
 * and fcntl.<p>
 *
 * These functions, while managed by the kernel, are advisory locking mechanisms
 * by default. That is, the kernel does not actually stop programs from reading,
 * writing or deleting locked files. Instead, each program must check to see if
 * a lock is in place and act accordingly (be cooperative).<p>
 *
 * This might be problematic when some programs are cooperative and others are
 * not, especially if you do not have the ability to recompile the uncooperative
 * code, yet it must be allowed to run.<p>
 *
 * As POSIX has evolved, provisions have been made to allow locks to be enforced
 * at the kernel level with mandatory locking semantics. For historical reasons
 * <sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup> and for practical reasons <sup>
 * <a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>, POSIX mandatory locking is generally
 * implemented such that it must be configured on a file-by-file basis. When a
 * program attempts to lock a file with lockf or fcntl, the kernel will prevent
 * other programs from accessing the file if and only if the file has mandatory
 * locking set (note: processes which use flock never trigger a mandatory
 * lock).<p>
 *
 * In addition, to enable mandatory locking under Linux, the target filesystem
 * device must be mounted with the <tt>mand</tt> option, for example:<p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * # mount -omand /dev/hdb3 /mnt/data
 *
 * # mount | grep /mnt/data
 * /dev/hdb3 on /mnt/data type ext3 (rw,mand)
 *</pre>
 *
 * To automate this across reboots, <tt>mand</tt> must be added to the
 * appropriate <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> entry. <p>
 *
 * Although Linux, Solaris and HP/UX are known to support kernel-enforced
 * mandatory locking semantics, some POSIX systems may provide no support at all,
 * while others may have system-specific configuration prerequisites. Some may
 * even enforce manditory locking semantics by default under certain conditions
 * while others may silently ignore mandatory locking directives or consistently
 * raise exception conditions in response to such directives. <p>
 *
 * Regardless of any wider scoped prerequisites, restrictions and behavioural
 * variations, it is generally true under POSIX that only specifically tagged
 * files will exhibit mandatory locks. <p>
 *
 * And it is generally accepted that the way to designate a file to be governed
 * by mandatory locking semantics is to set its sgid (setgroupid) bit and unset
 * its group execute bit.  This has become the commonly accepted practice
 * specifically because the combination is devoid of meaning in the regular
 * sense. <p>
 *
 * As a specific illustration, if mandatory locking is required on all
 * pre-existing files in a certain directory, then the corresponding
 * <tt>chmod</tt> invocation would be: <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * $ chmod g+s,g-x /path/to/directory/*
 * </pre>
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * <a name="note1"/>[1]</a>
 * The earliest versions of Unix had no way to lock files except to create
 * lock files. The idea is that two or more processes would more or less
 * simultaneously try to create a lock file in exclusive mode, via the
 * O_EXCL flag of the open( ) system call. The  operating system would
 * return success to the process that won the race, and a "file exists"
 * error to losing processes. One problem with this scheme is that it
 * relies on the winning process to remove the lock file before it exits.
 * If the process is running buggy software, this might not happen.
 * Some applications mitigate this problem by recording the process ID of
 * the winner into the contents of the lock file. A process that finds that
 * it gets a "file exists" error can then read the lock file to see if the
 * owning process is still running. <p>
 *
 * Still, lock files can be clumsy. In the 1980s, Unix versions were
 * released with file locking support built into the operating system.
 * The System V branch of Unix offered file locking via the fcntl( ) system
 * call, whereas the BSD branch provided the flock( ) system call. In both
 * cases, when the process that creates the lock dies, the lock will be
 * automatically released. <p>
 *
 * In a perfect world all processes would use and honour a cooperative, or
 * "advisory" locking scheme. However, the world isn't perfect, and there's
 * a lot of poorly written code out there. <p>
 *
 * In trying to address this problem, the designers of System V UNIX came up
 * with a "mandatory" locking scheme, whereby the operating system kernel
 * would block attempts by a process to write to a file upon which another
 * process holds a "read" -or- "shared" lock, and block attempts both to
 * read and to write a file upon which a process holds a "write " -or-
 * "exclusive" lock. <p>
 *
 * The System V mandatory locking scheme was intended to have as little
 * impact as possible on existing user code. The scheme is based on marking
 * individual files as candidates for mandatory locking, and using the
 * existing fcntl()/lockf() interface for applying locks, just as if they
 * were normal, advisory locks. <p>
 *
 * <a name="note2"/>[2]</a>
 * Even with mandatory locks, conflicts can occur. If program A reads in a
 * file, program B locks, edits, and unlocks the file, and program A then
 * writes out what it originally read, this may still be less than
 * desirable. <p>
 *
 * As well, it is generally true that nothing can override a mandatory
 * lock, not even root-owned processes.  In this situation, the best root
 * can do is kill the process that has the lock upon the file. <p>
 *
 * And this can be especially problematic if a file upon which a mandatory
 * lock exists is also available via NFS or some other remotely-accessible
 * filesystem, specifically because the entire fileserver process may be
 * forced to block until the lock is released. <p>
 *
 * Indeed, these effects of mandatory locking policy are commonly encountered in
 * the <em>Windows</em><sup>tm</sup> environment, where all locks are of the
 * mandatory style. <p>
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * <b>Research Results</b>:<p>
 *
 * After some experimentation under JDK 1.5/6 and Linux (at least Fedora
 * Core 4), research results indicate that, after mounting the target file
 * system device using the described <tt>mand</tt> option and doing a
 * <tt>chmod g+s,g-x</tt> on the lock file before issuing a
 * <tt>FileChannel.tryLock(...)</tt>, it is still possible to delete the lock
 * file from another process while the resulting <tt>FileLock</tt> is held,
 * although mandatory locking does appear to be in effect for read/write
 * operations. <p>
 *
 * This result was actually the one anticipated, because deletion of open files
 * is generally possible under POSIX.  In turn, this is because POSIX file
 * deletion simply removes the iNode entry from the file's parent directory,
 * while any processes with open file handles continue to have access to the
 * deleted file.  Only when all file handles have been released does the space
 * occupied by the file become elligible for reuse.<p>
 *
 * In other words, under both <em>Windows</em><sup>tm</sup> and Linux (at lease
 * FC 4), it appears this class is a practically useless extension to the base.
 * Under Java for <em>Windows</em>, the act of holding a file handle open is
 * enough to produce a mandatory lock on the underlying file and also prevents
 * the file's deletion (i.e. the ultimately desired behavior occurs with or
 * without <tt>NIOLockFile</tt>), while under Java for Linux it appears
 * impossible to use NIO to produce a lock that prevents file deletion, yeilding
 * protection against inadvertent modification of the lock file practically
 * useless. <p>
 *
 * To put it another way, even after the much-heralded introduction of Java
 * NIO, without further resorting to platform-specific JNI alternatives, we
 * might as well still be back in the early 80's, because we cannot guarantee,
 * in a cross-platform manner, conditions better than offered by the earliest
 * known lock file approach, even on systems that do support mandatory file
 * locking semantics.  Instead, we must simply still trust that all software is
 * well written and cooperative in nature. <p>
