/**
 * This class consists of the data structure for a Constraint. This
 * structure is shared between two Constraint Objects that together form a
 * foreign key constraint. This simplifies structural modifications to a
 * table. When changes to the column indexes are applied to the table's
 * Constraint Objects, they are reflected in the Constraint Objects of any
 * other table that shares a foreign key constraint with the modified
 * table.
