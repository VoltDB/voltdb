// fredt@users 20030727 - signature altered to support update triggers
/*

Contents of row1[] and row2[] in each type of trigger.

AFTER INSERT
 - row1[] contains single String object = "Statement-level".

AFTER UPDATE
 - row1[] contains single String object = "Statement-level".

AFTER DELETE
 - row1[] contains single String object = "Statement-level".

BEFORE INSERT FOR EACH ROW
 - row2[] contains data about to be inserted and this can
be modified within the trigger such that modified data gets written to the
database.

AFTER INSERT FOR EACH ROW
 - row2[] contains data just inserted into the table.

BEFORE UPDATE FOR EACH ROW
 - row1[] contains currently stored data and not the data that is about to be
updated.

 - row2[] contains the data that is about to be updated.

AFTER UPDATE FOR EACH ROW
 - row1[] contains old stored data.
 - row2[] contains the new data.

BEFORE DELETE FOR EACH ROW
 - row1[] contains row data about to be deleted.

AFTER DELETE FOR EACH ROW
 - row1[] contains row data that has been deleted.
