 * Facility to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread.  <p>
 *
 * Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution or for repeated execution at
 * regular intervals, using either fixed rate or fixed delay policy. <p>
 *
 * This class is a JDK 1.1 compatible implementation required by HSQLDB both
 * because the java.util.Timer class is available only in JDK 1.3+ and because
 * java.util.Timer starves least recently added tasks under high load and
 * fixed rate scheduling, especially when the average actual task duration is
 * greater than the average requested task periodicity. <p>
 *
 * An additional (minor) advantage over java.util.Timer is that this class does
 * not retain a live background thread during periods when the task queue is
 * empty.
