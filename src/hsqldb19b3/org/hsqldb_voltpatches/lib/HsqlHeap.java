/**
 * Provides the base HSQLDB interface for Heap ADT implementations. <p>
 *
 * In this context, a Heap is simply a collection-like ADT that allows addition
 * of elements and provides a way to remove the least element, given some
 * implementation-dependent strategy for imposing an order over its
 * elements. <p>
 *
 * Typically, an HsqlHeap will be implemented as a tree-like structure that
 * recursively guarantees a <i>Heap Invariant</i>, such that all nodes below
 * the root are greater than the root, given some comparison stragegy. <p>

 * This in turn provides the basis for an efficient implementation of ADTs such
 * PriorityQueue, since Heap operations using the typical implementation are,
 * in theory, guaranteed to be O(log n).
