/**
 * The mapping in the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> programming language
 * for the SQL <code>NCLOB</code> type.
 * An SQL <code>NCLOB</code> is a built-in type
 * that stores a Character Large Object using the National Character Set
 *  as a column value in a row of  a database table.
 * <P>The <code>NClob</code> interface extends the <code>Clob</code> interface
 * which provides provides methods for getting the
 * length of an SQL <code>NCLOB</code> value,
 * for materializing a <code>NCLOB</code> value on the client, and for
 * searching for a substring or <code>NCLOB</code> object within a
 * <code>NCLOB</code> value. A <code>NClob</code> object, just like a <code>Clob</code> object, is valid for the duration
 * of the transaction in which it was created.
 * Methods in the interfaces {@link java.sql.ResultSet},
 * {@link java.sql.CallableStatement}, and {@link java.sql.PreparedStatement}, such as
 * <code>getNClob</code> and <code>setNClob</code> allow a programmer to
 * access an SQL <code>NCLOB</code> value.  In addition, this interface
 * has methods for updating a <code>NCLOB</code> value.

 * <h3>HSQLDB-Specific Information:</h3> <p>
 *
 * First, it should be noted that since HSQLDB represents all character data
 * internally as Java UNICODE (UTF16) String objects, there is not currently any
 * appreciable difference between the HSQLDB XXXCHAR types and the SQL 2003
 * NXXXCHAR and NCLOB types. <p>
 *
 * See {@link org.hsqldb_voltpatches.jdbc.JDBCClob} for further information.
