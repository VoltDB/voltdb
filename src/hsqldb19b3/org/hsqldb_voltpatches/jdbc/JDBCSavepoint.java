/**
 * The representation of a savepoint, which is a point within
 * the current transaction that can be referenced from the
 * <code>Connection.rollback</code> method. When a transaction
 * is rolled back to a savepoint all changes made after that
 * savepoint are undone.
 * <p>
 * Savepoints can be either named or unnamed. Unnamed savepoints
 * are identified by an ID generated by the underlying data source.
 *
 * <!-- start Release-specific documentation -->
 * <div class="ReleaseSpecificDocumentation">
 * <h3>HSQLDB-Specific Information:</h3> <p>
 *
 * SQL 2003 standard does not support unnamed savepoints. However, this
 * feature is supported from version 2.0.<p>
 *
 * If the connection is autoCommit, setting savepoints has no effect as any
 * such savepoint is cleared upon the execution of the first transactional
 * statement. <p>
