/**
 * Represents of an instance of an OTHER field value. <p>
 *
 * Prior to 1.7.0 there were problems storing Objects of normal column types
 * in columns of the type OTHER. In 1.7.0 changes were made to allow this,
 * but as all the conversion took place inside the engine, it introduced a
 * requirement for all classes for objects stored in OTHER columns to be
 * available on the runtime class path of the engine. <p>
 *
 * In 1.7.2, the introduction of real preprared statement support allows us
 * revert to the pre 1.7.0 behaviour without the artificial limitations. <p>
 *
 * The classes for stored objects need not be available to open and operate
 * the database in general. The classes need to be available only if a
 * conversion from one of these objects to another type is performed inside
 * the engine while operating the database.
 *
 * The current limitation is that in SQL statements, values of type String
 * (CHARACTER and related SQL types) cannot be stored in columns of type
 * OTHER. This limitation does not exist for String values assigned to
 * PreparedStatement variables.
