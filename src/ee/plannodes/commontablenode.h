/**
 * This plan node represents the semantics needed to evaluate common
 * table expressions, or CTEs, including recursive CTEs.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * WITH RECURSIVE EMP_PATH(LAST_NAME, EMP_ID, MANAGER_ID, LEVEL, PATH) AS (
 *   SELECT LAST_NAME, EMP_ID, MANAGER_ID, 1, LAST_NAME
 *     FROM EMPLOYEES
 *     WHERE MANAGER_ID IS NULL
 *   UNION ALL
 *   SELECT E.LAST_NAME, E.EMP_ID, E.MANAGER_ID, EP.LEVEL+1, EP.PATH || ‘/’ || E.LAST_NAME
 *     FROM EMPLOYEES E JOIN EMP_PATH EP ON E.MANAGER_ID = EP.EMP_ID
 * )
 * SELECT * FROM EMP_PATH;
 *
 * The structure of a plan for a statement like this is as follows:
 * The main query (the last "SELECT *" statement in the example above)
 * will contain one or more SeqScanNodes that are CTE scans, and those
 * nodes will contain a "stmt ID" for a subplan that has this node at
 * the root.  When the subplan rooted at this node is executed, it
 * will produce the common table, which can be referenced multiple
 * times in the main statement.

 * The child of this node is the "base query", i.e., the LHS of the
 * UNION ALL in the example above.
 *
 * In the case of recursive common table expressions (the example
 * above is one), there will be a separate statement that is the
 * recursive part of the CTE (this is the RHS of the UNION ALL in the
 * example).  The stmt ID of the recursive statement is an attribute
 * of this node.
 *
 * The recursive part of the query (which references the CTE, EMP_PATH
 * in the example) will initially see EMP_PATH as containing the
 * output of the base query, and is then executed repeatedly, with
 * EMP_PATH containing the result of the previous iteration, until no
 * more rows are produced.
