/**
 * A large temp table class that uses LargeTempTableCache to request
 * tuple blocks, allowing some blocks to be stored on disk.
 *
 * A few assumptions about large temp tables (some of which may not
 * continue to hold moving forward):
 *
 * - Tables are inserted into (and not scanned) until inserts are
 *   complete, and thereafter read-only
 *
 * - Tables can be scanned by only one iterator at a time (as a result
 *   "pinned" is a boolean attribute, not a reference count)
 *
 * - Client code is responsible for unpinning blocks when they are no
 *   longer needed.  When inserting tuples, call finishInserts() to
 *   unpin.  Iterators will automatically unpin blocks after they are
 *   completely scanned, and when their destructors are fired,
 *   RAII-style.
 *
 * This makes it easier to track which blocks are currently in use,
 * and which may be stored to disk.
