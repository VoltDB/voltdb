/**
 * This is a dead simple buffer chain that allocates fixed size buffers and
 * parcels out smaller, fixed size individual allocations to consumers.  These
 * allocations are carved out of the fixed size buffers.  Allocations
 * are allocated and returned in LIFO order.  So, if an allocation is
 * deleted from a data structure, the data from the most recent allocation
 * must to be copied to the deleted allocation, so that the most recent
 * allocation's data may be recovered.  The clients all do this.
 *
 * A *block* is a fixed size allocation, which has been obtained from
 * malloc(3). These are chained together.  They are all the same size
 * in bytes.  This size is set when the allocator is constructed.
 *
 * The head of the chain of blocks is the *tail block*.  Blocks which
 * are not the tail block are completely full.
 *
 * An *allocation* is a hunk of memory which is returned to a client of this class.
 * Its size is set when the allocator is constructed.
 *
 * Note, there are few checks here when running in release mode.
