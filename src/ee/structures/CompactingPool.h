// Provide a compacting pool of objects of fixed size. Each object is assumed
// to have a single char* pointer referencing it in the caller for the lifetime
// of the allocation.
// TODO: Strictly speaking, relocation could continue to work as long as there
// was only one referring pointer AT A GIVEN TIME. That would simply require
// that the CompactingPool allocation get notified of the "move"
// -- but this simple API is not yet implemented, so the referring pointer
// must remain at a fixed address for the lifetime of the allocation
// -- only the allocation itself can be moved.
// We may loosen this requirement in the future, if needed.
// Note, once the caller provides a "forward pointer" to the allocation, it
// gives up control of the forward pointer's value for the lifetime of the
// allocation. The caller must avoid copying or caching this pointer or
// exposing it to asynchronous uses on other threads.
// Whenever Compacting Pool code is passed control on the current thread,
// it reserves the right to relocate past allocations on the thread and reset
// their forward pointers to copied versions of their allocations.
// Currently, this only happens when (other) allocations are freed.
