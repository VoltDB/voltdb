     * to always fit when they are relocated to fill a hole left by a
     * deallocation. This enables continuous compaction to prevent deallocation
     * from accumulating large unused holes in the page.

     * needed. The caller is expected to guard against this fatal condition.

     * managed through a single point of reference (See class StringRef).
     * The relocation feature makes this allocation method a poor choice for
     * objects that could be referenced by multiple persistent pointers.
     * allocateExactSizedObject uses a simpler, more general allocator that
     * works well with fixed-sized allocations and counted references.
     * Also, the sole persistent pointer is assumed to remain at a fixed
     * address for the lifetime of the allocation, but it would be easy to add
     * a function that allowed the persistent pointer to be safely relocated
     * and re-registered.
