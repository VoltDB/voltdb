//TODO: The long-term intent is that there be a ubiquitous exception class that can be thrown from anywhere we
// detect evidence of a significant bug -- worth reporting and crashing the executable, exporting any remotely
// relevent detail, including stack trace AND whatever context information can be piled on at the point
// of the original throw AND any context that can be added via catch/re-throws as the stack is unwound.
// There should be a major distinction between this case and other cases:
// This type should NOT be used for resource issues that can arise unavoidably in production, no matter how
// curious we might be about details when that happens -- that should have its own somewhat separate handling.
// This type should NOT be used to react to user actions that conflict with known system limitations
// -- those should be raised as non-fatal "user error".
// Right now, FatalException seems to be very close to what's needed except that:
//   It is being sometimes used to flag resource issues (in Pool.hpp, maybe elsewhere?).
//   It lacks a friendly API for adding annotations after the initial construction/throw
//   (in a way that allows including the information in reports and feedback).
// This is a little hacky but it's a way of showing the intent at the points of throw/catch/re-throw.

// Purposely avoiding inheritance from FatalException for now, because the handling seems just a little dodgy.
// Instead, FatalException functionality is accessed via a data member that never actually gets thrown/caught.
// In contrast, std::runtime_error is working out well as a base class, in the normal case when (re)throw goes uncaught.

// This section is for Paul's experimental debuggability features.
// He has, in a past life, effectively used and shared with other developers hacks like this.
// John H seems initially skeptical but tolerant about the whole business.
//
// The features are accessed primarily through these macros:
//
//     DEBUG_ASSERT_OR_THROW_OR_CRASH(CONDITION, STREAMABLES) -- a flexible substitute for assert
//         That is, instead of
//
//             assert( pos < size );
//
//         use something more informative like
//
//             DEBUG_ASSERT_OR_THROW_OR_CRASH( pos < size,
//                                             "pos " << pos << " >= size " << size <<
//                                             " for " this->debugInfo());
//
//         which supports the dynamic runtime option of a fatal throw that can, under some conditions,
//         provide even MORE useful context output as the stack unwinds prior to crashVoltDB.
//
//     DEBUG_IGNORE_OR_THROW_OR_CRASH(STREAMABLES) -- a flexible substitite for throwing runtime errors
//         That is, instead of
//
//#ifdef DEBUG
//             char msg[512];
//             snprintf(msg, 512, "pos %d <= size %d", pos, size);
//             throw SomeRuntimeErrorThatCouldMaskASeriousLogicError(msg);
//#endif
//
//         use the more flexible and informative
//
//             char msg[512];
//             snprintf(msg, 512, "pos %d <= size %d", pos, size);
//             DEBUG_IGNORE_THROW_OR_CRASH(msg << " for " this->debugInfo());
//             throw SomeRuntimeErrorThatCouldMaskASeriousLogicError(msg);
//
//         which also has added runtime options, like the ability to throw a genuinely fatal error.
//
// Both of these macros support a dynamic runtime option to crash immediately with a SEGV.
// It's still early to tell whether that has any advantages over an assert or TRULY fatal throw.
// Part of the problem is that Paul has not been able to get a usable stack trace on his development
// machine from EITHER of the two semi-redundant mechanisms supported in the code, including the one
// in SegVException.cpp.
