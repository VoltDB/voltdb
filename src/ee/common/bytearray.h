/**
 * A safe and handy char* container.
 * std::string is a good container, but we have to be very careful
 * for a binary string that might include '\0' in arbitrary position
 * because of its implicit construction from const char*.
 * std::vector<char> or boost::array<char, N> works, but we can't pass
 * the objects without copying the elements, which has significant overhead.
 *
 * I made this class to provide same semantics as Java's "byte[]"
 * so that this class guarantees following properties.
 *
 * 1. ByteArray is always safe against '\0'.
 *  This class has no method that implicitly accepts std::string which can
 *  be automatically constructed from NULL-terminated const char*. Be careless!
 * 2. ByteArray has explicit "length" property.
 *  This is what boost::shared_array<char> can't provide.
 * 3. Passing ByteArray (not ByteArray* nor ByteArray&) has almost no cost.
 *  This is what boost::array<char, N> and std::vector<char> can't provide,
 *  which copies elements everytime.
 *  Copy constructor of this class just copies an internal smart pointer.
 *  You can pass around instances of this class just like smart pointer/iterator.
 * 4. No memory leaks.
 * 5. All methods are exception-safe. Nothing dangerouns happens even if Outofmemory happens.
