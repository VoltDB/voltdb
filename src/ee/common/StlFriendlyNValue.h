 * Add a thin layer of stl-friendly behavior -- but no additional data members -- to NValue.
 * Rationale: NValue shies away from heavy use of operator overloading, etc. and for some good reasons
 * (IMHO --paul).
 * But it's these kinds of things that grease the wheels for using NValues in stl containers,
 * so as needed for their sake, construct or cast the NValue references to StlFriendlyNValue references,
 * preferably in a way that avoids copying.
