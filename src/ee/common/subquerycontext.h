* Keep track of the actual parameter values coming into a subquery invocation
* and if they have not changed since last invocation reuses the cached result
* from the prior invocation.
* This approach has several interesting effects:
* -- non-correlated subqueries are always executed once
* -- subquery filters that had to be applied after a join but that were only correlated
*    by columns from the join's OUTER side would effectively get run once per OUTER row.
* -- subqueries that were correlated by a parent's indexed column (producing ordered values)
*    could get executed once per unique value.
* The subquery context is registered with the global executor context as candidates for
* post-fragment cleanup, allowing results to be retained between invocations.
